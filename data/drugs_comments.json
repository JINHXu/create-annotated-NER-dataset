{"body":"I am not saying MDMA addiction is not possible. Simply that it is a very unique and rare case among drug addicts. \n\nAny anecdotal evidence either one of us provides is irrelevant. Of drug users, And addicts alike I’d still reckon MDMA is pretty low on the list of drugs used DAILY. \n\nI have known a lot of drug addicts, who have been addicted to a lot of drugs. The ones that use drugs everyday. The drugs they used everyday are as follows; opiates, cocaine, classic amphetamines (meth), ethanol, cannabis. But that is all anecdotal evidence. \n\nI don’t doubt what you say about your friends. But I was once young and uneducated, at age 15 consuming MDMA. Even back then I never saw anyone form an addiction, nor use daily for an extended period of time. \n\nThat is all homie!"}

{"body":"Most of the time when i'd come home high what gave it away was the size of my pupils or if my eyes were red. If you have light colored eyes then probably try to take things that don't make your pupils big, and if you do try not to stand too close to your parents when ya talk to them/try not to be in super light areas around them. Use eyedrops if you smoke.\n\nI think the answer could be somewhat subjective since some people are better at hiding drug use than others. Imo kratom and opiates(not an amount that will make u 'nod') and low doses of stimulants are very easy to hide. If your parents are knowledgable about pinpoint pupils from opiates maybe not as much."}

{"body":"Everyone in the comments is saying not to do it, and I understand why, but I don't like the idea that if this person decides to do it anyway, they will have received no harm reduction advice about dosage or test kits or anything else in any of the comments. I'm not going to weigh in on the \"should you or shouldn't you\", I'm just going to give you harm reduction tips for the (even small) chance that you decide to go through with it, because I don't feel comfortable leaving this thread with no information like that. Especially if anyone else is reading this because they have the same question/are thinking of likely trying it. You never know what decisions people will ultimately make. \n\nA safe dosage for the first time would want to be somewhere between 10 and 20 milligrams, I wouldn't exceed 20 (because of the potential for respiratory suppression and also just generally being overwhelmed if it's your first time) and my personal recommendation would be 15. \n\nA big thing to know about oxy is that it is often combined with acetaminophen, which is really hard on your liver, so if you're taking more than one pill (for example if your oxys come in units of 5 mg of the opioid each and you're trying to get to 10 or 15) you might want to learn how to cold water extract (a process that can be as simple as using a coffee filter and a glass) to get the opioid out into the water, which you would then drink, while leaving most of the acetaminophen in solid form in the coffee filter. This way you're not overloading your body with acetaminophen which can be extremely dangerous. \n\nIf you know **for sure** that your oxy is oxycodone hydrochloride or some other formula that doesn't include acetaminophen/APAP, you can take it without extracting or filtering anything. Or, if your pills are oxycodone acetaminophen but 1 pill contains 10-15 already, taking 1 pill with the acetaminophen still included is still safe. Just remember that you are **never** recommended to take more than 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at once, and a dose that's healthier for your body in general caps off at 500. \n\nAnother point - I'm not sure how you and your friends \"got your hands on\" some oxy, but fentanyl presses are a really big concern lately in the illegal market. If you just stole a family member's left over / forgotten-about prescription from a surgery, you don't have to worry about this, but if you got them from a friend of a friend or a friend's \"reliable contact\", please please please do yourself the favor of getting a fentanyl test kit and making sure what you have is really oxy. Fentanyl is a ridiculously potent opiate and overdose is possible even in micrograms. I'm guessing you and your friend are opiate naiive, meaning that your body has never processed opiates before, so that would be an especially dangerous situation. \n\nEssentially, #1 thing to worry about is test kit, #2 thing to worry about is dosage of the opiate itself and #3 thing to worry about is acetaminophen intake - consider cold water extraction if you have multiple pills with a small dose of opiate combined with a larger dose of APAP. \n\nLastly, if you're going to be experimenting with these things, be very strict with yourself about frequency. Don't dose opioids multiple days in a row, definitely don't start re-dosing multiple times a day (tolerance buildup and chemical/psychological dependence happens quickly, and besides, re-dosing is never satisfying and always makes you feel like you fell short of what you were looking for). Don't give yourself any leeway or cheat room on this. Obviously the #1 way to prevent an opiate addiction is to never start taking opiates, as everyone in the comments is expressing. But if you're going to do it no matter what everyone says, be strict wth yourself. Set limits. Ideally put weeks and months in between your recreational usage if you're going to use it ever again at all."}

{"body":"Xanax aka Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine. Benzos are fucking awesome disassociatives. There's very little euphoria but the high is still really really nice. You feel detached from the world around you, extremely tired. Things feel like they are very slow. The feeling is similar alcohol but more mild and without the the euphoria. People sometimes become very violent on it. Addiction is pretty common and while overdose isn't a risk (LD50 1200mg/kg) but withdrawal from benzos can kill. So idk if you wana stay away or not. If you like depressants like me you'll love it but if you are more into stimulants you'll probably hate it.\n\nGHB is 4-Hydroxybutanoic acid, a prescription drug and I've never done it so I can't say anything about the high."}

This summer I took two tabs of acid one day, the next 7g of shrooms (because of the supposed cross tolerance) and those shrooms bent me over the table and sent me to another universe as if I was baseline on my tolerance. Worst case scenario if you're not feeling much from the shrooms or second acid trip just smoke some weed 2 hours in and they'll kick in, that's how I always make it work if I wanna trip two days in a row"}

Dose your MDMA at this 4 hour mark.\n\nI would say by the 8 hour mark (or 4 hours after the MDMA) the shrooms will havee run their course, and you'll start coming down from the mdma too.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nHave fun.

{"body":"you’re right on this. some dealers spray their shit with glass because it makes the weed look more dank (when in actuality it could just be shitty weed that they’re trying to hype up). the CD test isn’t actually always accurate though, as one of my friends was growing her own stuff once and scratched a nug against a CD just to see if it scratched and it did... but she knew for a fact it wasn’t laced because she’d been growing it herself from the beginning. so take that one with a grain of salt, but you can usually tell when stuff has been laced with laundry detergent and such. it’s probably not as common for weed to be laced with coke, though, because coke is so much more expensive, js.\n\nwith regard to dealers lacing their shit with fent, you’d think that they’d be concerned about keeping + sustaining business or something if their stuff keeps killing people off. but it’s actually the opposite, tbh; it brings in more revenue. hardcore drug addicts are more excited about a batch of heroin, for example, that’s potentially laced with fentanyl because they view it as so good people are literally dying from it. they want to achieve that kind of life ending high as a result, because they don’t think it’ll affect them to that extent (or, if they’re far enough gone, they no longer care...). i’m not saying it makes sense, because to me it doesn’t, but that’s what i’ve gotten from my friends that have used/use heavier stuff."}

I told him that I violated probation for possession of drugs.\nHe had a grin from ear to ear. At first I thought to myself 'oh fuck', he started getting even more curious asking \"what kind of drugs\" and \"when the last time you used was\". I lied about it all.\nHe started getting friendlier talking about his charges and how he's been in different jails for years. He talked about his meth addiction and how he still gets high in prison.\nBeing the naive one I thought that he just stashed some crystals in some food or like some kind of parcel. How wrong they I was.\nThe reason he was asking me if I used, what kind and how long ago is so that he could pick/eat my scabs...\nI shit you not, he wanted to eat my scabs.\nApparently meth bubbles up from your skin and forms a scab. If one were to ingest enough meth, it would still get a person somewhat high if they were to eat a bunch at once.\nSafe to say, I immediately became nauseous and puked up whatever I had the night before into the toilet.\nI told him I wasn't aware that meth scabs were such a delicacy in there and told him I don't do meth.

{"body":"Idk how this works in the UK, and I'm uncertain about how this works in the US from a legal/insurance policy stand point, but I would be very surprised if a therapist (assuming we were talking about psychotherapy and not psychiatry) were to give their notes to insurance. A psychiatrist will absolutely report a diagnosis to insurance, but I'm fairly certain a therapist would. Even so, this won't get you in trouble. Worst case scenario, doctors may be more apprehensive to prescribe narcotics in the future.\n\nMy drug use is likely we'll documented on my insurance record, and it's never given me an issue. Employers won't see it, the government won't see it, and they can't force any medical intervention or treatment on you. What you say in talk therapy is not considered medical, abd therefore likely irrelevant to your records. Again I'm not sure, but I'm fairly certain this is the case. \n\nAsk your therapist what they are required to report, and what may go on a medical record. If this was a concern, therapy wouldn't work; no one would be truthful, and your therapist will likely be happy to explain their involvement with records. (it's a fairly common concern ). I would be very surprised if they even had access to your records.\n\nPregabalin doesn't have much abuse potential. While there are some psychiatrists who might be unwilling to prescribe meds like this, most are more understanding. I've never had an issue with doctors or psychiatrists not prescribing medications despite my substance abuse disorder diagnosis that I see whenever I get a bill (including Adderall and oxycodone)\n\n\nSo yes you should definitely tell them if you want to, but should find out from them if it concerns you."}

{"body":"I grew up in the church and they brainwashed me to see all drugs as the same. In fact we did a project in 8th grade where we had to research a drug and present to the class it’s effects and it’s negatives. They gave us websites and told us to only use the websites given. For instance a group presented weed and they talked about how smoking it brought on effects like psychosis, anger, laziness, and other things that were obviously completely made up. I didn’t even know what psychosis meant I just new it was bad. They said LSD made you see demons and that you’d think you could fly and jump off a building and that you’d eat people. The meth and heroin ones I got to say was pretty accurate they’d have a hard time making those ones up since we were old enough to know what they did and how they worked and all that and everyone was kind of in agreement of how bad they are so there was no reason to make anything up. You might ask why we didn’t know what weed was actually like from tv and everything they were extremely careful in putting us in a environment they could control our minds. My parents however at home didn’t care very much on what I watched we were a lot poorer than the rest of the people at my school. And those rich parents sheltered the fuck out of there kids. When I got older and ended up trying the drugs I realized how fucked up the school was and basically called them out at church in between services. They were not to happy about that and everyone who was still brainwashed by them or there parents cut ties with me. I still believe in God but I do not believe in the church."}

{"body":"5 year user of various research chemicals and novel drugs as well. Psychedelics, the whole area is exploding right now, everybody wants to trip. I agree LSD and psilocybin are probably the two primaries, but there's alot of a gray area ways to purchase them legally so long as you aren't intending to ingest it. I think the legality and being able to purchase them on the clearnet as opposed to darknet entices a wider range of audience. From what I have read around the internet over the recent years LSD has also gotten easier to synthesize. \n\nGood opiates are hard to get and expensive anymore I think that's why we are seeing it declining in use. People are either okay with getting fentanyl/trying to seek it or they are trying to avoid it altogether.\n\nAnd like everyone else has said the THC vape pens. THC distillate it's gotten so cheap and so potent. I think this trend will continue to grow and explode. It reaches a larger audience than traditional bud because they are discrete and are potent. \n\nPersonally I think cocaine is making a bigger comeback. I feel like there's just more meth around anymore. Between cartels and local cooks the market is oversaturated and the standard of quality anymore is pure ice. I also have seen the price of meth go down alittle and the purity go up. \n\nI'd look into popular substances frequently posted about in r/researchemicals.

{"body":"Vape shops do sell kratom but it’s usually low quality and over priced. Much better would be online. Can’t source here I don’t think even though it’s legal in most places but just google “best kratom vendors”. \n\nIt feels like a mild opioid, but it’s not technically one, it just has very similar alkaloids that bind to opioid receptors. \n\nIt might make you puke if you drink too much, I’ve done that many times \n\nI recommend just getting powder and chugging it with water rather than capsules. Also I sometimes add lemon juice to the water, kind of makes it taste better and I’ve heard the lemon juice can kind of pull the alkaloids out making it more effective, which I’ve noticed, but I’m not sure if it’s actually valid. Lemonade is perfect to mix it with. \n\nThe taste is very bitter and many find it very unpleasant. While I certainly don’t enjoy the taste I don’t think it’s really THAT bad, to me it just tastes like really strong, bitter green tea. Imo kava tastes much worse\n\nThere’s different strains or veins too which can have different effects. I take it to sedate myself because I love downers but don’t wanna get into the harder stiff, plus it’s legal so it’s easy for me to obtain. \n\nso I like red vein, which is the most like a traditional opiate and more sedating. White vein is more energizing, and green is like a mix of the two. \n\nOverall I like it, it’s not a really strong drug and probably won’t be nearly as euphoric as “real” opioids like heroin or prescription painkillers (though for some it could in high doses, it’s just for me whener I try taking a high dose I puke it up)"}
{"body":"This post was basically me admitting I’m a shit person doing shit things and that I need to change. So, uh, already on that part of it, thanks. I know I’m an addict because I buy drugs even though that money should go to other things, and that’s why I need to stop.\n\nAnd **I’m transitioning because it’s either that or I’m dead, because I will literally kill myself**. Like, do you have *any idea* what’s it’s like to have parts of your body that shouldn’t be there? To have a voice that isn’t yours? To have a face that conveys the wrong image? To face society as something untouchable in many places of the world? It’s more than enough to make a person want to kill themselves. And that would irrevocably scar my mom and my girlfriend, so I’m not allowed to do that, unfortunately. It would change them for life, even though I’m in the blissful void of nothingness. As much as I want to. Doing that to them would be unforgivable, even if I had no awareness anymore, as I want *so, so much*. With health insurance, my medication is only 5$ a month, and doctor visits are $40, which I do every three months. All of that totals to $180 dollars a year for keeping myself from committing suicide. That’s really not a point of debate. \n\nI waited for six years for the right puberty, suffering through years of horrible things from self-harm, suicide attempts, opiate use, being ostracised by my peers, never finding anyone I could relate to who knew what I was going through, searching high and low for materials to look like who I felt inside because they weren’t widely available back then, going to *any* length to feel comfortable in my body before my mom let me take hormones when I became an adult. Don’t you *dare* tell me I should wait any longer to feel halfway decent in my body when my real problem is the street drugs and the reason why I use them (which is currently up for debate). \n\nYeah, I shouldn’t be spending my money on intoxicants. I *know* that. That doesn’t stop me from doing whatever I need to in order to be not sober, because I am *addicted*. I’ve had panic attacks and suicidal episodes because *I know I will end up homeless if I continue down this road*. My mom has always been there as a safety net, but I shouldn’t put her through this, and she won’t always be there. \n\nI am *very well aware* that I am going to face dire consequences should I continue this path, and that I need to fucking stop. \n\nTell me something I *don’t* know."}

{"body":"Smoke less.  Don't give in to the \"just one more\" peer pressure.  Don't try to show how strong you are by smoking more.  Take one hit, then stop.  See how you feel.  Sometimes it takes 1-2 minutes for the high to \"creep up on you\".  Don't worry that other people are smoking more, this is about you.  Don't worry that you're missing out, there'll be more weed later.  If one hit is still too much for you, you need to try shittier weed (not a bad thing, many people prefer midgrade weed).  But it probably won't be.  If it's not enough, next time you smoke, take a hit from the beginning of the joint and then if you feel up to it, take a second hit from near the end, after it's gone around a bit.  No more than two, and again, wait for it.  The more occasions you smoke, the more comfortable you'll get with the state, and then you can try smoking more.  For now, less is more for you."}

{"body":"Meth could (actually almost certainly does) increase the cardiotoxicity of cocaine. The risk of serious injury would therefore be dependent on your pre-existing risk of heart conditions. \n\nBut cocaine (essentially) works by blocking the dopamine transporter and meth (essentially) works by causing dopamine to rapidly release from the dopamine transporter. So taking both together might be less effective than you hope."}

{"body":"So on distillate lighter color is higher quality but what about regular oil? I've only gone off of what has got me the highest with the fewest amount of hits and the best cart I've ever had was brown and not runny at all. I don't think I've gotten a clear distillate cart that wasn't cut with propylene glycol so maybe that's why I haven't got the higher quality ones. Also distillate may be 85% but I think the high you get off of it is much worse compared to say 27% thc medical bud.\n\nAlso if you don't get a cart from a dispensary the thc percentages probably vary a lot for 60 to 90 % and that's without being cut with propylene glycol. I'm just guessing but I'm sure black market carts aren't always made the best way and that results in the percentage being lower.

I'd say once you get into your 20's and *don't live with your parents/guardians* you can experiment with other drugs.\n  \nI personally am not really a fan of MDMA. I think everyone who is mentally sound should try LSD at least once in their life. You might also enjoy mushrooms. If you find you like psychedelics, try DMT, which imo is like the holy grail, it's simply amazing.\n  \nI really recommend staying away from all opioids. Don't do meth or crack either unless you want to be an addict. If you find yourself wanting to try stimulants cocaine is probably your best bet, but again be smart about it and don't do it all the time, it will lead to addiction."}

{"body":"Hello /u/throwaaaway10101, if it's your first time with a new substance, check out our Wiki pages on [**common drugs**](/r/Drugs/wiki/drugs) and the [**drug knowledge base**](/r/Drugs/wiki/knowledgebase) or use the search option to the right and then feel free to come back with any unanswered questions. You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports\n\nAs a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. \n\nYou will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.\n\n[Post removed]\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"I don’t think it was skunk weed or that you smoked salvia had anything to do with that, I feel like it’s pretty often it happens that people think they hear voices and stuff, but it’s just you’re imagination making you shit ur pants. Kinda like when you were young watched a horror movie, and when you tried to sleep you were just imaging monsters under your bed or something, making you scared af. \n\nHappened to me once too when I smoked for the 2nd time, wasn’t voices tho. I was super high and decided to watch the old tv-series COPS, after watching a couple episodes I just went to bed, and started hearing banging on the door screaming “police open up” was a bit confused but then realized that it’s just me imagining some crazy shit and that I’m also reallyyyy high. \n\nI think it happens cause there always was this little stigma about, weed making you hear or see things, causing psychosis and shit. And that’s how they imagine their first time will be like, thinking there gonna hear or see things or something like that. \n\nAlso a lot of people will believe in the weirdest things they think about, had a friend that was a bit too high and he mentioned something about a heart attack couple minutes later he thought he’s having one. Just cause he felt how his heart was beating in his chest, and thought he’s gonna die or something. Was quiet funny to watch. \n\nYou probably just was too high and overreacted a bit. \n\nAnd if u don’t hear anything when you’re sober, ur completely fine, just overreacted to much imo.\n\nKinda off-topic but I miss how the first times smoking weed felt like, cause i feel like the first times are always unique, and weird, kinda scary a bit cause you didn’t really knew what to expect, but for me after a long time smoking weed it basically feels almost the same every time, not that I don’t enjoy it, but you just feel chilled out and happy. Idk how bout you but first times for me were the funniest and craziest."}

{"body":"This post is super classy of you, OP. \nIn addition to what you've already mentioned, I'd like to add in that\nEvery.\nSingle.\nPerson.\nthat's become an addict, i.e., \"junkie\" absolutely\n*Never*\nintended for it to happen. Nor did they realize the hell that would be brought upon their lives. Like the op said, drugs make you feel good for a reason.  They cause people to become addicts after the first freaking time they use! People that had it all, a happy marriage, smart, beautiful children, a great job,  all the high-status boxes checked, risk it all for that drug. \n\nThe rough-looking people shamefully humiliated, standing at the busy intersections holding cardboard signs begging for money, sleeping out in the cold each night, without shelter, exposed to the elements, exposed to predators, human \u0026amp; animal, scraping for any bit of coin they can to get by without feeling the effects of withdrawal, not to get high, mind you,  just in order to get through the day, feigning like a mother fucker, their teeth falling out, and, if their teeth haven't all fallen out, they're dealing with severe pain, abscesses, infections, pus, putrid odor, and that's just their mouth.  The rest of their body is covered with wounds caused from the needle injecting the drug into their body incorrectly causing a small wound that they ignore so it turns into a massive wound, a giant hole in their body part that's dying so it's black, and oozing pus, and smells like death already, like smells like an actual dead fucking animal, and the pain they feel from that wound makes their rotten tooth pain feel like a soft pillow to lay on. And they certainly can't go see a Dr. for these problems.  Oh hell no. And it's not because they can't afford it (which they obviously cannot) Mostly it's the terror and panic they feel thinking of being committed as a patient and the overnight stays which will prevent them from 'working' to cop their drug. And then the thought of all the smug, and outright snarls they'll receive from the nurses and other patients, first at the mere sight of their person, second the wretched stench emitting from them, and thirdly, after assessing the wound, the pain felt in their heart, like a gut punch, from the nurses lack of covering up their disgust and headturns to inhale fresh air. Then there's the lack of patience and soft touch. Considering they've already deemed this individual as not even worthy of a smile or hello, they certainly aren't going to be gentle when they scrape the necrotic tissue and rinse out the bacteria. The nurse and Dr. are going to do it roughly, and they're going to do it quickly. IF they deem it unnecessary to keep you overnight, they're going to hurry up to get the hell away from you. A junkie would rather risk losing a limb, AND DO, to not go through that.\n\nOh, and withdrawals. Yeah. If you can even remember the last time you had the flu. Multiply that feeling by at least 100. The horrible sweating out and then immediate freeze that follows from the moisture covering your body,  the inability to cover up enough to warm up or uncover and undress to cool off, even though it's all completely pointless as the back and forth of sweating and freezing occurs at a continuous, successive pace. Incessant shivering. So intense you cannot hold a thing. The awful feeling of joint pain all over the inside that hurts so bad you can't even sit up in bed. Your mouth is so unbearably dry you almost feel as though you're suffocating. And then the shits hit. Non stop. Like a fucking waterfall. Completely exhausted and beyond miserable. Dry heaving when you've finally choked up all the bile from your stomach, cuz there's no food to throw up, and being unable to catch your breath in between heaves. Then jumping back on top of the toilet because the shits are coming out. Again. All the while still shivering from the cold chills while covered in sweat. Tired of slowly dragging yourself to your bed (if you're even lucky enough to have a bed or toilet because most addicts have lost their homes and every friendship at this point and are living on the streets now - so be sure to consider this scenario on the fucking streets where not a soul gives a shit about you) so, instead, you take your blanket-wrapped body and lay on the floor next to the toilet. Anything to make this easier. There's absolutely nothing as far as medicines that you can take that are going to help, this is your life now when you're unable to score enough to hold it off. And holding off the withdrawal is the stage you're at. Because the amount you took at first, the one that felt Oh So Good, like you could take on the entire world, and everything just felt so good and so right, the euphoria that permeated your body and mind was one you've never felt before, and you just had to feel again, yeah you'll never see that amount work it's magic again. You're addicted. So no more euphoria. Now you're just taking a bit more, and a bit more, and a bit more, just getting by and staving off withdrawal.\nEvery. Single. Day.\n\nBy the way... you can't work anymore. You're incapable of holding a job. Not that anyone would hire you with the way you look anyway. And smell. The day you realized you had to go in and work your shift and you didn't have drugs to get you through was the day you didn't wake up to the realization you needed help, no, it's the day you tried working without drugs. You weren't able to meet up with your dealer pre-shift; it's all his fault. Your coworker is getting on your nerves.  The customers are all needy bitches. Your boss is pissing you off. Boy, not having that drug is really messing with your mind. All shift you've been swallowing intense anger. Everything is irritating. Not to mention the thought of finally getting your hands on a bag after work is mind-fucking the hell out of you.  The anxiety is unbearable. And finally, that irritation you've felt all shift comes out. To the wrong person. And just like that drugs took your job. Your income. Your way of getting your drug. You certainly don't have time to find another job. Fuck. It already takes most the day just to get in touch with your dealer. \n\nThis is typically the point where thievery starts. Usually closest to home...the wife's (or husband's/parents) jewelry. Even the god damn ring your mom was given upon the death of her grandma, your great-grandma. The one she treasured more than anything. It got you a bag. Then anything else of value around home gets pawned. And, considering you've already been riding a fine line with your wife (or husband, or parents) as they've noticed massive changes in you since you began using,  they're just not sure what is causing this change in you.  But it sure is causing a lot of fighting. And threats: divorce, being kicked out. And now that you've lost your job and are stealing! Yep. That's it. You're out. They just can't take anymore. \nSo, now it's time to turn to friends. You sleep on their couch for a while. And, while they're at work during the day, you search around their house to see, first, what's valuable enough to pawn that they likely won't notice is gone for awhile. Then, secondly, after those items are gone and you're up to the stuff that's going to be a bit more noticeable, when the withdrawals are starting to kick in, you start an inner dialogue with yourself, telling yourself it's no big deal, you'll pay your friend back/get the item back, etc. And then, they kick you out too. And that's how you lost all your friends.\n\n\"No way I'll ever be an intravenous drug user.\"\nOh, yes the hell you will. When you realize that's the quickest way to get high/stop the withdrawals. When you realize it's the way to make a bag go the furthest. You worked so very hard to get that bag, selling your family heirlooms for it and all, you'll stretch that bag as far as you can. I mean, hell, remember when you said \"I'll never do drugs.\" Ha. Ha. Bet you believed that too. It's just a matter of time before you're a needle junkie. \n\nAnd after you've lost your family, all your friends,  your job, or career, your home, A home, when you've finally gotten your bag and you're sitting in a crack house surrounded by your new crack buddies that's when you start thinking about all those things you've lost for this fucking drug. This fucking drug you hate so very, very much.  The one you tried on your own to quit, but ran back to when the withdrawals got so bad and one of your crack buddies said, \"just take a hit and it'll all go away\". You'll hurt so badly inside remembering the tears your kids were crying when you were packing your bags after being told you were kicked out. Their tears and them begging you to stay are the worst. The look of utter sadness in the face of person you promised to love for forever. That fucking look from your best friend. The one you've been friends with since kindergarten. The one that stood with you on your wedding day. That look of disappointment and pain from being stabbed in the back. Stabbed in the back by YOU. You remember them all. But the drug still wins.\n\nAnd, finally, even if you decide you're going to quit, even if you find a resource to help you, there's the chemical and biological hell you will have to face. The withdrawals, yeah they will finally go away after many weeks. But then, after they do, your brain and body have to relearn how to function again. Like, your brain can no longer make the chemical, Dopamine, the chemical that's released when you're happy. Everything has to be learned all over again. And that takes time. Recovery is hell too. And every single day after.\n\nThe ONE THING you will hear every single person that's ever been a drug addict say, every single one, is:\n\"I wish I never took that first hit.\"\n\nIt ain't fucking worth it."}

{"body":"Lmfo Coke has nothing to do with my depression depressed.\n\nI can't remember much from kindergarten, but what I remember vividly is the feeling of anxiety. Every fucking morning I was mortified, crying, and begging my parents not to take me to kindergarten. But with time, I got better with hiding anxiety, no more crying...\nHigh school came, and anxiety never faded, it became anxiety and depression. \n\nSo yeah, I'm depressed and anxious a long, long time before even trying drugs. It was my last year at the university when I tried weed for the first time. \n\nAfter Uni, I scored a super nice job, well paid, and that motivated me to go to therapy.\nAfter a few sessions, my therapist thought it would be better if I see a psychiatrist too.\n\nSince my first visit to my psychiatry, I was on: Prozac, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Remeron, Xanax, Valium, and a lot of combos between these drugs. \n\nNothing works aport form benzos, but I can't do benzos for more than a few weeks. I was addicted to Xanax, and I don't want to wd from this shit ever again. \n\nCoke is the only thing that makes me feel alive, and it's the only thing that keeps me going."}

No, I don't want to hear about your SO 24/7. For fucks sake NO I don't care about some petty drama amongst people I've never met!\n\nEveryone latches on to something (human condition yada yada) and I've simply made the choice that for me it's drugs. Sure, there are hundreds of other things I can do, with a vastly higher financial cost, lower reward, and having to expose myself to many things I hate (Such as crowds).\n\nI've heard this accusation directed against myself before. It always comes from the most drama-obsessed, dull and ignorant people existing. No, we would have something else to talk about if you gave a shit about the world around you. We would have something else to talk about if you had any actual knowledge or interests. We would have lots to talk about if you ever gave a fuck about anything outside your own little world but most people don't and that's fact.\n\nIf that's your \"realization\" you should also realize that this is just plain conformism. Still, if it gave you the kick you needed to quit drugs then that's great!\n\nHowever I can agree that hippies specifically are the most boring people I've ever met in my whole life. But that's probably the whole \"ohhh nature maaaaan\", \"peeaaaceee and looooveee brotheeer\" and the rest of that delusional bullshit they're so fond of."}

{"body":"Yes, and even if the cop kept it, I can almost promise you he wouldn't be smoking it himself.  Even in areas where weed is legal locally, it remains federally legal.  Virtually all departments forbid their officers to use marijuana.  First, to avoid issues with the Feds.  Second, in the event of an officer involved shooting/accident/lawsuit, weed lingers in the system up to a month.  If the cop tests positive this all of a sudden casts his choices in a horribly negative light.  I know of some cops who would crush paraphernalia (step on a crack pipe for instance) just to rid the user of it and not even touch it or flush seized drugs if in sight in a house.  Now cocaine, that's a different story :-)"}

{"body":"Well, it depends on your usage.. and that was a personal opinion/rate."}
{"body":"this entire post comes off as judgmental but whatever\n\n\u0026gt;why would you do drugs with all the well known downsides to it?\n\nthis is a pretty broad question, and it’s also quite subjective depending on the user imo…first of all, there are several different drug classes and drugs within said classes. some are more dangerous than others, some have more downsides than others, etc. take opiates vs. psychedelics for example—opiates have significant abuse/addiction potential and people overdose on them every single day, but psychedelics essentially have no addiction potential and it’s almost impossible to overdose on them afaik. so my point is, the “well known downsides” of which you speak may or may not be present depending on the user, the drug being used, etc…\n\n\u0026gt;why choose to risk overdose, depression from comedown, addiction, taking synthetics, acting like an idiot in public, prison time, a bad trip?\n\nagain, much more subjective than you seem to realize. personally, I do tons of research on a substance if I plan on trying it so that I have a general idea of what to expect and fully understand the precautions, risks, etc. going into it. not all drug users are irresponsible and uneducated, in fact I’d wager that a good percentage of them are like me in regards to researching substances beforehand and all that.\n\n\u0026gt;if you want to be more sociable, feel good (dopamine), see vivid/cool visuals why not do it in a healthy and zero risk way (work on your social anxiety, go for a jog, watch a damn action movie)\n\nI mean, are these things and drugs somehow mutually exclusive? lol, I go for jogs and watch movies and I also like to drop acid, idk what your point is here. obviously some people use drugs as a form of escapism, or a way to cope with their problems (social anxiety, depression, whatever), but not everyone who does drugs is your stereotypical junkie loser.\n\npersonally, I've always found drugs in general to be super interesting. I’m fascinated by their effects on the human brain, particularly our consciousness/perception. isn't it crazy that you can ingest so many different substances that make you think entirely different thoughts and feel entirely different things than you normally would? I think so. that’s why I do drugs, partly because I love experiencing altered states of consciousness and partly out of pure curiosity.\n\nidk what your religiosity has to do with this but feel free to enlighten me on that lmao"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; my point is that we are evolved to release dopamine from doing things we need to do which is why   \n\u0026gt;  \n\u0026gt;things feel good to do because we need/want to do them\n\nI'm sorry but that wasn't your initial point, you said:\n\n\u0026gt; Or do things make us feel good because we want to do them? \n\nWhen that is never the case, we do things that make us feel good because of the reaction that they illicit. If snorting cocaine gave no reaction then nobody would want to do it.\n\n\u0026gt; it is also true that we *do things because they feel good.* \n\nWe absolutely do this, i'm not disputing that fact. 'Want' has nothing to do it, the only reason you want to do something is because it makes you feel good, wanting something doesn't make you feel any better really."}

{"body":"You can buy fake urine , will they watch you pee??\n\nI was drug tested for probation every month for a long time. As long as I stopped using drugs 4 days prior to my test i would pass for any substance. However my PO was okay with me smoking weed, which is a whole different story. Obviously cannabis takes forever to leave your system, so you’ll either need fake pee or to stop smoking weed. I’ve heard detox drinks work but not on every situation in regards to cannabis. \n\nYou’ll probably get some feedback on this post from some people lecturing you just to stop using drugs if you’re getting tested. But obviously if that was an option for you you wouldn’t be asking for this advice. Lol . My only other advice is to hydrate extremely well or flush your system  before you get tested. If it’s not getting lab tested you can drink a couple gallons of water the day before your drug test and take vitamin b so your pee has color in it to avoid suspicion\n\n\nEdit : spelling"}

{"body":"So I'll start off saying in 2001 I was prescribed adderall 30 in the Morning 30 in the afternoon! let me tell you 21 was a bad age to give someone such a controlling substance! However, I needed it in 4th or 5th grade I was given a diagnosis of ADD,ADHD, AND ODD!  Ritalin hadn't worked for me all through Highschool! I abused them for a few years! They were great, amazing, euphoric I went from getting ready to be shit canned from my job to gliding through college and landing a very good job. However, when Vyvanse came out I opted to switch to them, as they lasted longer than adderall and the body can only process so much of it at a time! Hardcore abusing them is almost impossible! \n\nin the last 10 to 15 years, we have all seen the media monsters created! People who do Meth are Zombies, live in trailers, enjoy 20 ounce sodas, and blow up homes , garages, trailers, and vehicles all in the name of getting one more hit! \n\nI've always been an experimental drug person! Only things I have never done are Crack(however I did more than my fair share of coke), Heroin has hooked and swallowed more souls than multiple wars in history! Marijuana is out of the question as I have allergic reactions to it, I break out in hives, feel lethargic, and my eyes start burning! I'm definitely and Upper person by nature as standard doses bring me down to cognitive functioning reality! I love Ecstasy, MDMA, shrooms, acid, DMT, and doing whippets at the same time as those!\n\nI always believed the media about Meth and avoided it, until one day at a concert with my buddies (MGK incase you were wondering) it was Dec 23rd. We were all having a good time, I was also keeping an eyes on my daughters(Legal Adults) as they rode with me but were meeting their friends there. \n\nFive songs and five 24oz beers, I'm in the bathroom! Another guy I know is there, he whispers I'm gonna do a line go to the stall next to me if you want one I'll slide my tin over! I didn't sat OK, THE FIVE BEERS DID!! He passed the altiod  time under to stall wall, I grabbed the straw in dim light honestly thought it was coke! Yeah, I learned real quick how a sinus burn, shots right into your eyeball!! I wanted to tell, but I was in public I walk out and ask him what the F%$K was that he said Crystal straight from Mexico, just got home today! While on Vacation for 14 days, someone turned him on, he brought 2 ounces home! I was furiously pissed! Meth was on my list of DO NOT TOUCH, you could turn into a real Zombie!!\n\nI got back to my seat moments later, the beat kicked in and the bass sounded amazing! Major reason I enjoy psychedelics and ecstasy, you can feel your environment!  I went and bought him a two beers! He asked me how I felt, I remember saying F$%king amazing! He ended up buying me a beer an hour later, I took a sip he put some in the beer he bought me!\n\nThree days later,it is Christmas Morning, I'm completely exhausted not sure if I can function to finish the day out. I call that guy he got me a good deal from someone else he met. It was a pretty dirt cheap ounce honestly! The guy I picked it up from hands me 6 empty capsules and tells me to fill them with the powder, only take 1 in a 24 hr timeframes, don't hurt myself! So later that nights I fill up all the empty capsules, they each weighed roughly 1.6 grams! \n\nI'm going to end my story here! People should not avoid meth because your gonna turn into a Zombie! People should avoid it because it makes you feel F$%King Amazing! Do not eat it, still not sure what happened in the first hour the phrase Twacked the F$%K Out, yeah......\n\nWhen I paid attention to the razor I was using turn into straight rust, I decided to walk away and not touch it again! Long term could tear ya up internally! Seems most addicted don't get out with a full set of teeth for a reason! R.I.P. Razor Blade!"}

Idk if it's just me, but LSD was surprisingly clearheaded. Mentally I actually felt normal (free of anxiety, depression, and filled with motivation). My experiences on LSD have been more therapeutic than any medication I've had or any combination of medications. Tho my Buspar is working well (also a serotonin agonist), if I could I would switch to microdosing LSD. Not saying it will be the most therapeutic for other people, that has just been my experience.

He was already on a high dose and then went in his house to grab more for the night for us, and took more while he was in the house and didn’t tell me. \n\nHalfway to MY house he starts nodding out in the car, no big deal. But when we get to my house I absolutely cannot wake him up. Looked exactly like a heroin overdose. I continuously checked his pulse which was fine, his heart was beating pretty hard though. But the horrible thing was that he would stop breathing. For around 30 seconds at a time and I would have to shake him and slap him as hard as I could and then he’d start breathing again. \n\nThis continued for an hour, I called a couple friends over to the house because I was incredibly torn on what to do. I would’ve called an ambulance immediately, (I should have, I know) but he was on probation and I just wasn’t sure what to do. \n\nI got around to his side of the car and unbuckled him and my friends were all standing around making suggestions and one said that I just needed to slap him as hard as I could. \n\nThat still didn’t work. \n\nFinally I took both hands and clapped him on the face literally with all my strength and his eyes shot open and he looked around and I was like “Bro. Bro. Are you okay.” And he still didn’t answer and i just continued to talk to him, “we’re at my house, remember?” \n\nAND THEN THIS MOTHERFUCKER NODS OUT AGAIN AND I SLAP HIM AS HARD AS I CAN AND HE FINALLY COMES ALIVE and all he says is \n\n“Ow........” \n\nAnyway.

{"body":"I agree with your point.\n\nTo shed some light on the matter, addiction isn't based on the substance as much as it's based on a reaction in your body. You can be addicted to anything. The issue is the side effects, of which alcohol has many worse than benzos.\n\nAlso, benzos are easier to adjust your dose with. Developing a tolerance? Work with your Dr to lower your dose for a few weeks so the medicine is effective again. Alcohol works similarly, but comes with additional caveats making our difficult to determine effective dosing and treatment. I'm fact, there are psychiatric meds (can't remember right now) that work on the same receptors as alcohol in the brain. So, even if you still choose alcohol over benzos, you have a clean alternative that can be prescribed to you."}

{"body":"You’ll never stop needing or producing dopamine, it’s an excitatory neurotransmitter (ie stimulates the post synaptic neuron, sends a message) that you absolutely need and is involved in many cognitive processes like memory, reward, pleasure and alertness. \n\nStimulants don’t usually mimic dopamine (like how psychedelics mimic serotonin at a particular serotonin receptor, 5HT2A/C) but will release it into the synaptic gap via transporters and inhibiting reuptake. \n\nStimulant abuse can down-regulate/decrease DA receptors/transporters because your neurons adapt to the constantly high dopamine levels these drugs cause. Discontinuing stims can cause withdrawals because your neurons do not have enough receptors to deal with the dopamine you normally release sober. In addition your neurons might make less dopamine, so when you do not have a stim active in your blood you will not meet that dopamine demand on your own. \n\nAt least not for a while, your brain is very plastic and ready to change to its environment but other habits of stimulant abuse couldve caused some brain or other organ damage."}

{"body":"It's great to do alone. I do MDMA alone maybe 3 or 4 times a year, gives me a real sense of gratitude for my life and puts meaningless stresses into context. \n\nIf you never done it before I'd recommend first testing it, make sure it's actually MDMA. Then do a tiny amount 30mg, maybe less. You'll not feel anything unless your one of the tiny few that have an adverse reaction and that small of a dose is very unlikely to do any long term damage. If you have no reaction try around 80mg a week later, you'll feel it but it won't be overly intense. Then try around 120mg at least a month later. \n\nKeep at least a month between doses and you shouldn't have any come down at all if you doing it at home relaxing in your favourite chair. To me, it's no more dehydrating than weed but you might struggle to pee for an hour or 2 so drink if your thirsty but you won't need more than a glass or 2. By drink I mean water. \n\nAlcohol will increase the psychedelic effects but you won't remember much the next day if you drink more than 4 to 6 units. Don't drink alcohol your first few times. \n\nWatch a film, doc, live concert, listen to music, have a nice soft sheet to stroke and you'll be in heaven. \n\nIf you're selfconscious, plan about 4 to 6 hours alone time because your pupils will be massive and it's very noticeable if you have light blue eyes like me.\n\nEnjoy."}

{"body":"Mod of r/Benzedrex here, I'll drop my opinion.\n\nThe person who started the sub can get a bit aggressive with the use of Benzedrex, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out this nasal decongestant isn't really /intended/ to get someone high.\n\nBenzedrex makes it more difficult to abuse than something like DXM even. With DXM you can chug a bottle of syrup, eat a bunch of gel caps, etc.\n\nBenzedrex NEEDS to be extracted to be used safely.\n\nThe extraction itself isn't difficult, but the fact that it needs to be performed to get high means that the producers know what Propylhexedrine can do. Plus they add in some Menthol and Lavender oils which can also be extracted, but if not can lead to some unpleasant nausea.\n\nNow, onto the actual opinion as to what's going on: The other day a couple posted about how they took some LARGE doses of Propylhexedrine while being relatively new to the substance. I'm talking less than 10 times between the two of them.\n\nThe female ended up having a seizure, and I'm not sure what happened to the male. However, she had a seizure from taking TWO AND A HALF COTTONS WORTH. Beginners should NOT go above a SINGLE cotton until they get a solid grasp on it's effects.\n\nThe miscommunication happens here, the person who started the sub says that doing doses up to 750MG can be safe, ASSUMING the user has A) a tolerance to the substance, B) has been using the substance long enough to know exactly what will happen, C) has gone over 500mg previously, and D) knows the risks that can come with it.\n\nNot just A, B, C, or D is true, but ALL 4 CONDITIONS have been met. Big doses are NOT for beginners with this drug. DXM can be intense if you take too big of a dose, benzedrex can be flat-out dangerous.\n\nWhen increasing the dose with PPX, we do NOT recommend going over an extra 125mg at a time. If you're used to 250mg and want more, go to 375mg. NOT 500mg.\n\nWe're still relatively new and trying to figure out how we want things to be ran, and how we want to enforce harm reduction.\n\nBenzedrex is pretty under-the-radar as far as \"legal\" highs go, with DXM and Research Chems having the spotlight for a \"legal\" high."}

{"body":"I’ve experienced something very similar, on a brownie made of 14grams of weed. \n\nMy trip went a little like this  \n\nI felt great for the first few hours, just incredibly baked. \n\nThe first thing that happened that was unusual at least for weed was auditory hallucinations. Someone would talk to me and the noise they made would become very stretched out, and it sounded like it was ripping. \n\nThis was also accompanied by a small blip, where my vision jumped as if I had lost a couple seconds of time. \n\nI began to see pixels across my sight. They started off on the bottom right and bottom left in my peripheral vision. They didn’t look amazing but I didn’t really mind them. Gradually they got more and more intense and they slowly crept towards the centre of my vision and became more colourful, until eventually they formed what appeared to be like a grid as you reported seeing. My grid was very clearly made up of pixels and I could distinctly see each one. \n\nI remember at this point I looked affords the room at a closet and saw it made up of large colourful pixels. This is the only visual I remember 100% enjoying. \n\nAs this was going on I was reporting it to my girlfriend, who had eaten a similar dose but not to the same effect. \n\nI remember the turning point when things went from bearable to horrible was when I turned to her and said: \n\n“I don’t like it.”\n\nImmediately after the words escaped my mouth the visuals turned into a shit storm. The colour left the pixels and they turned into horrible static covering my vision. The pixels themselves weren’t on objects that I was looking at, they were as if a film had been placed over my eyes and I was looking through the pixels. \n\nHaving had such a dose and experiencing such intense visuals now, I was certain in my confused and scared state that I was doing severe damage to my brain and in the morning I wouldn’t be the same.  This thought did not help my already bad trip. \n\nIt began to cross my mind that I thought I was dying. In your story you spoke about the loss of your ego, mine was intact the entire time. \n\nThe thought of my death made strange cartoons pop up in my vision. Little skeletons that looked similar to sans from undertale accept when I saw them I only associated them with terror. Little gravestones that seemed as if they were running. Multiples at a time, placed like checkerboards across my vision. \n\nThis was the turning point. What was already terrifying me was about to get worse. \n\nSensations began to form in my brain. At first there were the knots, as if someone had taken part of my brain as if it were a string and formed a knot in it, then rigged it very tight. \n\nNext we’re the comets, that struck my brain as if it were made of pixels. I felt pixels that were part of my brain being destroyed. \n\nThey were excruciating, but it was still going to get worse. \n\nNext thing I felt was the lick. I still get frightened thinking about it. If you’ve seen a tigers tongue you’ll know they have many many little hooks on them that latch onto the meat they eat and help tear it away off the carcass. I felt as if a giant tongue was attacking my brain and tearing at it pixel by pixel. Accompanied with the sensation I heard this horrible squelching noise. These licks would happen for about a minute at a time, on intervals of 10 seconds between them, then I’d be safe for about 20 minutes before it happened again. \n\nI remember turning to my girlfriend and begging her to choke me unconscious. She didn’t, but I soon realised anyway that if I was unconscious this torture I was experiencing would carry on in my dreams. \n\nAll this while  hundreds of sans the skeleton mock me and leads me to hundreds of gravestones across my vision. \n\nWhat brought it back under control was clutching onto my girlfriend and pushing my eyes against her skin. It was comforting that she was there and eventually the sensations stopped and I was able to try and sleep. \n\nThe experience didn’t stop there, but at least it was no longer painful. \n\nEvery time I fell asleep I would wake up to a strange nightmare. \n\nAt first i was lying on my back and I would fall backwards, like many do when falling asleep except I fell very far and when I sat up after waking I still felt like I was falling backwards for an initial moment. \n\nThen I turned to lay on my side. My arms were crossed over each other. Every time I fell asleep I felt like they were nasty pointed tendrils curling around each other. I would jolt up in a hurry and push myself up by my arms with my hands on the bed, but I would still feel them curling around each other, again just for an initial moment. \n\nEventually after maybe 7 attempts I was able to fall asleep. \n\nCertainly an experience. I felt okay the next day, and fine by the day after. \n\nI never used to be able to get “too high” when smoking weed, but now I definitely have a comfort zone. I get quite anxious if I start getting too high. \n\nIt hasn’t stopped me from smoking. I think I took a break for a couple weeks but I’m back into it now and still really enjoying it. \n\nEdibles? Never again."}

My recommendation would be to stop using all drugs for now, and replace it with some other hobbies. \n\nWorking out literally gets you high, improves your mental health, and self confidence. You could also pick up art, like music, drawing, anything. For me it has the same therapeutic effects and escape drugs give me. \n\nIf you dont have a job, then you should get one. It will help occupy your time, alleviate boredom and you'll enjoy the paycheck. \n\nYou can do this man. It will not be easy, and the changes you seek wont happen tomorrow.

It doesn’t mess everyone up but I’ve seen it catch up to people and put them in a really bad state of mind. I think everyone needs to weigh the pros and cons and have a clear understanding of psychedelics before they experiment at a young age.

But a drug that has gotten popular is DXM (dextromethorphan) a disassociative and hallucinogenic cough syrup, used to be found a lot in robutissin in the US, and benalyn in the UK. \n\nTo go with that DPH, Diphenhydramine, has seen a slight increase. A deliriant found in some cough syrups, mostly benadryl. \n\nAlso, a lot smaller drug that has been getting some more popularity, is benzedrex. That nasal inhaler/rub stuff. People extract a stimulant that is similar to MDMA or amphetamines, from the cotton through acidic liquids, and drink it.\n\nThese are all obviously legal highs.

Thats the reality (with few exceptions) \n2) think that pure coke will burn you more than the cutted one...How it could be possible? Nearly pure coke it's easy on your sinus because of it's purity....the cutted one is harder on your nose and the next days you'll notice that.\n3) only 0.1g of this substance? If you ask to some experienced user you will get always the same answer: If you have 1g of coke you will do 1g, no matter what you think before...It's really hard to put it away. So, it's really easy that 0.5g of heavy cutted or little cutted coke will last you only the evening/night you do it.\n\nHope you stay safe and hopefully you'll let go the idea of doing coke and change it instead for a good experience with a psychedelic, that will teach you something.\n\nPeace"}

I just so intensely remember a moment where we were each on our own couches both just tripping out and melting. All of a sudden my buddy kind of comes too from his CEVs and sits up, looks me dead in the eye and says \"remember when I was you?\" Then he just starts laughing maniacally, which made me laugh just as hard.\n\nIt's so weird when you get in that headspace where you're tripping or on K or whatever and you so intensely relate to a person, or an object, or even an idea, in that moment that you almost forget that you are a separate entity and instead for a brief moment in time you are the embodiment of this other.\n\nDrugs, and by extension our brains that are changed by them, are fucking awesome."}

{"body":"The MDMA can only be up to 84% pure claims are based around either a poor understanding of the science or are a deliberate attempt to pass off inferior product as high quality.\n\nYou should read [**this discussion**](/r/Drugs/comments/xihdo/rdrugs_ama_series_mdma_aka_ecstasy_e_x_molly/c5moa3i), but basically if anyone claims their MDMA is 84% pure then they have performed no analysis at all and should not be trusted.\n\nWith almost all, the name is an abbreviation for [Drug](salt). In the case of MDMA, it is MDMA.HCl, amphetamine is usually amphetamine.H*_2_*SO*_4_* and LSD is LSD.tartrate.  Because these forms are ubiquitous, nobody bothers to mention the second bit because it's irrelevant. All doses you see for MDMA are referring to the HCl salt, which means that MDMA which is sold as \"the purest you can get, 84%\", is treated as 100% pure.\n\nThe reason sellers do this is because they usually *don't* have very pure MDMA, and they **want** people to make the mistake you have made and take more to account for crappy product. It is dishonest, confusing and misleading and if you have a choice you should avoid this vendor.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"damn, if you find the effect of benzos to be 'pleasurable' (apart from the anxiety relief / withdrawal relief) you probably shouldn't ever try opiates. the 'high' of a benzo is more comparable to alcohol than anything else. \n\npeople don't usually get 'addicted' to prescribed benzos unless they misuse them, doctors call it 'benzodiazpine dependancy' on their systems.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nheroin and other opiates will give you euphoria, it will actually get you high. your brain will associate the drug with the pleasure it creates, which can lead to addiction. Then, taking it regularly will lead to both addiction and dependancy. The longer you take a drug for the longer and worse the withdrawal symptoms will likely be.\n\nthe depressant effects of both (low heart rate, low blood pressure, etc) will potentiate both drugs too. So overdose on opiates is easier to happen if you're taking benzos."}

{"body":"Well, as long as the meal isn't a massive banquet the dose should be just as effective. If you have a small serving of vegetables and rice with teriyaki sauce or a sandwich or something the likes of that it shouldn't be enough to overly dilute the mushrooms. Apparently chewing the food slowly can also help so that some of the psilocybin is absorbed through your mouth.\n\nNow for the nausea, yeah that can be a problem. That's another reason why it's probably better to eat a smaller meal if you are about to trip. Personally, I rarely have an issue with nausea when it comes to mushrooms, but I've also had friends that throw up every time they trip. It really depends on your body, so listen to it!\n\nIf you've got a taste for umami then miso soup has a strong enough flavour to mask the taste of mushrooms.\n\nOtherwise, maybe grinding them up and putting them into capsules might be the best bet for you.\n\nEdit:\n\nOf course, you can eat them straight up, but for me sometimes if I don't eat anything with psychedelics I get stomach cramps. Again, it'll depend on your body, but I recommend eating the smallest thing with any psychedelic (except ayahuasca) just to not have an empty churning stomach."}

{"body":"Mod of r/stims here weighing in. u/RoboInSLowMo absolutely should not be in a position of power modding that sub. He made a serious mistake by using his alt u/Activetripper to comment on the sub. And instead of fessing up to it, he's trying to say now that it is the OP of that post  is r/Activetripper and its just completely wrong to abuse his power on that sub, and take a post that was well intended and completely ruin it. It is obvious Robo is r/Activetripper he posts on all the posts Robo does, baking up his claims, exactly like the OP said. He also posts on all the other subs Robo posts on like r/DPH and r/DXM.**He also capitalizes the first letter of every word just like Robo**  He also posted on r/stims advertising r/Benzedrex which I have linked a screen shot of here. What's damming about that is u/RoboInSlowMo has been banned from r/stims for a long time for promoting r/Benzedex after I told him he couldnt anymore. https://imgur.com/a/lrmqeRh Why would anyone but Robo make this kind of post? I've modded harm reduction subs for years, and I've never saw a mod behave this way. It is mind blowing to me. u/PLZeatmyPHATassPLZ u/5ubstanc3 what do you guys have to say about this? Anyone with half a freaking brain can see this account is obviously an alt for Robo. Why do you continue to back him up and promote this sub, when he is literally trolling the members who use it, and call them liars? Mods are supposed to be held to a higher standard in the communities they mod. This is just truly sad."}

A tradition where people lock up a monkey, set it on fire and beat it's head with sticks until it dies. Then proceed to eat it's brains. They were describing the monkey screaming as it's set on fire and this caused my experience to take a bad turn. I got very depressed and couldn't get the mental picture out of my head for the rest of the day. I had no idea you could have a \"bad roll\". But I had one."}

{"body":"Unfortunately I think there are still a lot of people in the world that just outright think drugs are bad. Now to be fair, abusing them and then doing things that are irresponsible are. I'm not debating that, but I also feel that you can apply that mindset to anything. So why does society single out drugs? My wife is like this, her mom is the same way. Weed is legal where we live (California) and they still believe that it shouldn't be. No matter who smokes it, they are automatically a bad person. I was heavily addicted to opiates about a decade ago. Oxy, Opana, and Fent were what I hoped I would find to buy on any given day. I can honestly say I am still addicted mentally, but on occasion I still get high on opiates. I'll say maybe 3 or 4 times a year. It's my vacation without going anywhere, and I love it. I'll admit, my high is not as great as it could be because I know my wife would hate me if she found out about it. However, I'm not doing anything stupid. I get high, and stay at home. If I am high enough one of my favorite things to do is get naked, and lay on hardwood floors next to a subwoofer while music plays. Sure, that's probably strange to some of you, but it feels great. But I know, there are people out there that would hate me for being under the influence while doing that. My wife, and mother-in-law are two of them. I'm pretty sure that's the long and short of it, some people just hate the fact that drugs are indirectly part of their lives. That they live in a society where others get high. I don't know, maybe everything I just said is, obvious and stupid, but frankly I dont see anything wrong with getting high. I'm almost 32 years old, and I'd get high with you. Just hang out and do nothing and have a great time doing it."}

I told him it was the strongest psych drug I've ever had and compared it to a coney island carnival ride that doesn't ha e the proper safety mechanisms in place. He still seemed onterested. Like he's heard of it but never had the opportunity/interest/follow-through to get it. He seems a good deal younger than me and was probably not using drugs back when the stuff was widely available at head shops. An hour after I proposed the trade he texted me but I was busy doing something. I trust his psychonaut status as he was talking up DMT. I haven't done regular DMT, just Cebil/Yopo extracted and both snorted or smoked. I don't really feel the need to blast off or breakthrough currently which is why I'm trying to get rid of my salvia and yopo. I decided to keep the salvia offer simple and give the yopo to my step bro who's big into Ketamine. Because the guy with L is enthusiastic about salvia I don't feel like I'm playing him at all. I may not go through with this because I don't really wanna deal with this particular dude outside of where I work. I also don't necessarily wanna risk my job to trade drugs with this guy. Though I'm almost certain to get away with it. A customer reported me to my manager for being high and  he had a hard time not laughing in her face.

If not, and especially if you're worried about your health. I highly advise you to test it, because XTC is the most drug known to be laced/cut with other shit that your body may not be handling good. Also follow MDMA rules by not taking more than 200mg in your first time, Dont stay dehydrated but also dont drain yourself with water, dont heat yourself up, if you felt like clenching your jaw the fuck up, eat some bananas or some gums, or take Magnesium prior to tripping, manage all safety practices please to enjoy the experience fully.. Make sure to eat, dance good, and enjoy!"}

{"body":"A classic example of poor understanding of neurotransmitters.\n\nNicotine pharmacology, from Wikipedia:\n\n\u0026gt; Nicotine activates nicotinic receptors (particularly α4β2 nicotinic receptors) on neurons that innervate the ventral tegmental area and within the mesolimbic pathway where it *appears to cause the release of dopamine.*\n\nI'm not going to pretend like I really know what I'm talking about. The brain is very complex and not fully understood; not even the people that study it for a living fully understand it. On that note, it's annoying to see people thinking that one mechanism is responsible for something. Above is an example of \"altering x neurotransmitter also affects y neurotransmitter\".\n\n\"Usually drugs that mimic neuroreceptors are more addictive than ones that only stimulate the release.\" - I don't think you'd find a source for that one.

{"body":"I've been there a lot before, but the only real way to get through it is to be ready and to just put yourself through the \"hell\" of sobriety for a while and make yourself get through it for some time. I had gone from starting drinking and smoking from 7th grade to consistantly smoking, tripping, taking opioids, and drinking whenever I could. It lead to a pretty horrible dependance on tripping because of my idea I was using psychedelics to self medicate and I slowly started to need tripping every week to feel at peace with myself. I doubt most people have that experience with psychedelics but everyone's different I guess. I was also horribly addicted to pills I would steal from my mom, to where I was not actually totally sober for more than maybe 5 minutes a day when I'd wake up if I didnt immediately take a dab or snort some pills. I knew that I had to quit everything I was doing but I wasnt personally ready, until I started losing friends. I dont know if the drugs were making me more withdrawn or making my friends not enjoy being around me. When I realized it could be because of my drug use I decided to throw myself into withdrawals from opioids. It was the shittest week of my life, I had stolen the pills from my mother so I couldn't ask her for any help and I assumed she would know what someone going through withdrawals would act like, so I acted like nothing was off, went to work, got anyone I could to spend time with me away from the house so I wouldnt be around my mom. I got through that but was still tripping and staying high as fuck constantly. From there it was easy to cut back from tripping because there wasnt a physical dependance. I had bought a tab of acid, thought of my headspace at the time, and decided it wasnt worth it to risk what helped me feel normal to go through hell. I wasnt willing to risk a bad trip since I knew I had done enough brain damage at the point I was at and realized it wasnt worth it. I sold the tab to a friend, and haven't tried to buy any psychs since. I've even limited being high to a mostly night time basis. It's a long road to sobriety, or at least mostly sobriety lol. I know you can do it if you stay strong. I always told myself that everything I felt during the rough periods was my own fault and a thought I remember one thought that would always reoccur. \"I dont regret what I did, I dont regret what I'm going through because of it, I'm happy because I know one day I'll make myself okay again.\" Stay strong, I know you can do it."}

They don't really produce any kind of euphoria, but that's not really what I'm going for most of the time these days. I do know opiates don't effect me the same way they used to; now they give me really bad anxiety, and sometimes they just make whatever  pain I'm in even worse, which is just crazy and fucked up.

Out of all the psychedelics ive tried (lsd, a few lsd analogues, mescaline, dmt, shrooms, 4-aco-dmt, 2-cb) it was by far the most similar to LSD.\n\nWhen i tried 15mg of 2-cb, it felt kind of chill and relaxing, but not in a stoney way. No mindfuck at all. I didnt like it though.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe try mixing ketamine with LSD. That sounds like what you're after. Highly recommend the combo."}

{"body":"Not the right place to post this but I'll help anyway. If the last time you smoked was 18 days ago, the chances are very likely that you will pass. If you want to be safe just drink enough water and exercise."}
{"body":"I have no source, it is anecdotal in the same way that people KNOW psychedelics are great for you most of the time. It stands to reason though that if caffeine alone can cause anxiety and a sense of overstimulated dread, and if l theanine synergizes amazingly (which it does IME) with caffeine to leave a more gentle and less forceful focus, then it is better than just caffeine or modafinil alone. I have not tried modafinil and this is maibly an assumption.\n\nNicotine is widely associated with studying on its own. Think the stereotype of the pipe smoking professor or writer. Coffee shops are big places of study where both are commonly consumed. One or the other, or both, are widely regarded to be of much use for studying but I have found them addicting, hard on the body, and leaves you with much less focus when all is said and done and they have worn off. Even a good nicotine high affected my focus in a bad way. It was like. Good for focus. But it was an unfocused focus. I dont know how to explain it beyond that. It was like a post orgasm sort of focus but kind of soft headed perspective and not really focus focus. Just relaxed and sort of daydreamy.\n\n\nHard stimulants are quite safe hp to a point. If we're talking about adderall i know that generally speaking you will not cause neurotoxicity up to 60 mg or so. But you still will pay the price and suffer a comedown which doesnt undo all of your studying but it does impact your focus. What you take out today must be paid tomorrow and thats what stimulants do. I know that they are safe. But they are hard on the body regardless. They age you faster which may not be noticeable but the rise in temperature and metabolism and body processes is undeniable. Caffeine does that too but not to the unhealthy degree that prescribed amphetamines do. I do not think that that is worth merely studying when I personally have found green tea to be all you need for mere studying purposes. \n\nAnd why take modafinil when something natural and less strong and less clinical sounding is available? I get that things can be as strong or weak as they need to be no matter what the chemical in question.\n\nThat ratio of l theanine in your cup of green tea is very high to the caffeine content of your average cup of tea. Generally speaking on the nootropics boards it is recommended you want to take roughly one part l theanine to two parts caffeine.  25 to 50 mg l theanine to 30/40 mg caffeine is even more than that. Which is why its synergized effects are so distinguished than from coffee with caffeine alone.\n\n\nAnecodtal evidence is in certain cases definitely applicable and more reasonable and not just to be written off. Other cases, like UFOS or alien abductions, not so much. I get that someone who takes a logic course may be able to best me in that debate, but i still feel its true. The context to the argument is what informs the prospective validity i think."}

Idk why so many people ask this question lmao.\n\nAnyways, I can tell you what I do know about weed. Weed works as an enhancer basically. Meaning shit is gonna taste way better, things will be more funny, and emotions will be more active.\n\nThis means if you have anxiety, it can boost that anxiety. Which isn't good. But this is only a problem with a small amount of people. \n\nTbh, just get weed and smoke it. I dont know why people ask questions, wheres the teenage courage of just diving right in to stuff. When I got the opportunity to smoke weed, I wasn't like, \"how will I feel if I do this?\", I just grabbed the fucking blunt and hit that bitch.\n\nTurned out being one of the best nights of my life, and now I've had since then a love relationship with weed. Theres a reason 62% of Americans want weed legalized. It's way better for you than any other drug you could do. Fuck alchohol and fuck cigarettes, smoke weed. It's a feel good drug."}
{"body":"There is no such thing as a \"problem\". We are all perfectly human, doing perfectly human things. Now, if you have dedicated your life to amassing material possessions, and wealth, then perhaps you shouldn't spend money on drugs. I have not dedicated my life to such things. I am here to experience- that is it.\n\nFurthermore, it is the law which makes drug addiction unsustainable, not the drugs themselves.\n\nedit: I can prove it: There is no specific metric or goal for the human species. None whatsoever. That also means there is no apparent point, and in that light all measurements, especially with regard to the human species, mean absolutely nothing. 'Good' and 'evil' are a figment of your vivid imagination. There is only one measurement worthy of any consideration, and that is the longevity of the species so that we can perhaps find our purpose. With that in mind, sustainability of the natural world is just about the only thing that makes any sense, and if that is the case, drug addicts contribute more to society by not contributing to begin with. You can not produce anything without first destroying *something*. Polarities are purely a side effect of the material experience, they're not real.\n\nedit # 2: the law makes drug addiction unsustainable in a number of ways, but the most detrimental of which, is the drastic inflation in value banned substances experience. a gram of heroin which costs $2.50 in Afghanistan, is suddenly worth $100 - $300 in America. you can not maintain a habit when addicted to unobtainium. furthermore, busting drug dealers further increases prices by causing artificial shortages in the supply chain. busting drug dealers also has the unintended consequence of causing a dealer vacuum. the market responds to shortages by raising prices high enough to attract dealers from other cities. that 1 drug dealer just turned into 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096.. before you know what hit you, you're in the midst of an epidemic. \n\nDrug Prohibition = exponential decay"}

Strapped down to a bed for three days with an ng down my throat and wore a tube for months after. I truly love food so much it is my drug and the meth oddly helps me enjoy it more because the horrible intrusive thoughts temporarily go away and I don’t feel the need as much to binge and purge. I can eat a slice of pizza and feel disgusting still but also “ok”. I know I am severely disordered and I keep all of my addictions very well hidden as I don’t want anyone knowing but I do know that when the meth started again recently I dropped 20 pounds in five weeks and everyone freaked out and noticed so I’ve toned it down a little. I know I need help but I don’t know where to even start :( I use sex as well as a coping skill and find myself sleeping with a lot of men very frequently."}

Some shit is alright to self medicate with like weed, but ketamine has an easily achievable anesthetic dose, which will not help your depression. PLUSSSS ketamine is very damaging to your kidneys, utterers, and bladder! Waaaaaaay more damaging than any SSRI/SNRI. That is another humongous reason that you need to be monitored while taking ketamine. So for both psychological and physical reasons, please do not self medicate with ketamine. \n\nEdit: I also just read that you wanna inject it which makes it way more likely that you could overdose. Also, ketamine is only approved in the US for use while in a doctors office under direct supervision because the sedating affects are so potent obviously. I also believe it is not administered daily. So for your own safety please don’t inject yourself. If you’re dead set on doing it, just insufflate it."}

You will feel floaty and weird and numb. Slightly drunk with like quarter tab of acid level visuals.

Very intense shit when mixed with psychs, I was never a huge fan of salvia by itself from the dysphoria I’d get for some reason, but I’ve always loved being on edge and in a sense terrified but filled with adrenaline from salvia as well as pcp although two completely different chemicals. When I would get these experiences with mixing psychs and salvia It almost felt like I was traveling through a different form of existence, as if every moment of everywhere was around me rotating around me as if I was in a spinning cylinder and rapidly sending me into some very intense yet extremely intricate scenes that were scary to some extent but way more interesting than scary, it was as if these occurrences were so fascinating I didn’t care how powerful it was because I was excited in a very confused way. Sorry for ranting this stuff is extremely hard to explain, it’s like explaining color to a blind person, it’s as if it is another reality."}
{"body":"Most people dislike the drugs I do but no one ever argues with me regarding drugs, friends nor strangers. The thing is my view on drugs when explained just seems to work for them. And some of these people have just straight up ditched their friends when they have smoked weed or done any other narcotics near other people. \n\nI always walk away and take my stuff alone just to be mindful of the illegal status and that it could have a negative impact on the people I'm with if I got caught. \n\nAnd if someone ever starts an arguement over it I just move along. An adult shouldn't need an explanation as to why everyone has the right to do whatever they want with their own body. Abortion and plastic surgery should both be illegal if based on the same arguement as to why drugs are illegal and no one ever thinks either lf those are 'wrong/bad'."}

{"body":"An injection will come on extremely fast-Usually within 10-15 seconds, and with PCP you would continue to get more intoxicated until the peak after several minutes, and depending on the dose be affected by the drug for anywhere between an hour or several hours.\n\nBesides whatever is happening inside fantasy land someone with a history of addiction would have about the best chance of keeping their cool while under the influence, even with drugs outside of their norm, and even after getting clean for many years- it's like riding a bike, you don't forget how it all works.\n\nAfter several years clean they likely would have been able to start carving out a nice life for themselves. A decent job, healthy relationships with friends/ family/ significant others, etc. and in general just be doing OK overall.\n\nI don't have much time so my fastest answer for someone who has an outside perspective is that drugs run on the same reward pathway in our brains as food,water,sex, self- preservation, etc. These are all mandatory and necessary for survival and eventually the continuance of the species- our main purpose in life. So you can imagine that when these drugs get involved they hijack this reward system and rev it up so much farther than possible naturally, that it's not wonder the body and brain becomes fooled that whatever is causing these huge releases of dopamine, serotonin, etc. Is not only a \"good\" thing, but something that is necessary for survival,  which is why it takes such hard experiences and consequences like us going to prison or dying and being revived to finally overcome that and get our shit together."}

Is that safe? He gave me 300 pills, so I’m good to experiment a bit. I’m not really looking for a high, just kind of personal improvements.

{"body":"When cigarettes came out we knew the effects of smoke inhalation over the course of a lifetime through unregulated industrial plants forcing workers to breathe in the smoke to get a paycheck as well as its effect on the population of people around the plant. Also people have been smoking for centuries scientists had historical data. The problem was advertisement and false claims weren’t regulated either so cigarette companies purposefully misled the general population into believing they were safe. You’re right we don’t have concrete data of long term use of vaporizers and it’s impact on cancer. But my claim was that vaporizers are safer than inhaling smoke from cigarettes, in lesser words, which is a fact."}

But at the end of the day, they’re fleeting and they aren’t showing you anything magical.\n\nCultivating a virtuous mindset and setting one’s sober mindset towards one that is balanced and fulfilled is a game that takes decades to master. Drugs don’t really help me establish the life and mindset that I want. So these days, I leave them alone.\n\nI’m still subbed to a bunch of places like this because my background interest is still there. But the feeling that they’re some sort of great mystery, a magic gateway to reality, is gone.\n\nI think this quote by the great Alan Watts is pretty apt and is well worth considering:\n\n\u0026gt; “[P]sychedelic experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but a glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. When you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones.

In my experience working with psychs, not all people taking equal dosages are shown the higher planes of consciousness, introspection and the more esoteric teachings these experiences offer.

{"body":"My biggest dose was 14gs dried shrooms. Me and my buddy decided we needed to eat an oz and see what kinda trip it would be. We lived right by a massive forrest preserve. So we ate them grab some bud and start walking to the woods as we start coming up. We were in the woods for about 20 minutes and we come upon a herd of deer. Without saying anything me and him both starting running after/with the deer he goes one way i go the other. The whole time were running i start thinking how like some Alice and wonderland type stuff where I'm about to go down the rabbit hole. Well after what we thought was a few hours we start heading back. Big mistake. Coming out of the dark woods to civilization was a mind fuck. We felt like we were melting through the asphalt as we were walking. We get back to the house and realize we have only been gone for an hour and a half. Also about this time i realize how slowly time is moving for me, and inreally start peaking. So while were at his house our buddy shows up with a person we knew who was shady and another person we didn't know at all, and our buddy is stomping around the house, muttering to himself looking for our scale because he had just gotten ripped on on some bud, he didn't realize how bad his attitude and demeanor fucked with us at the time. This sends my buddy into a downward spiral and he starts freaking out yelling at them to leave his house. I catch the shady person stealing my dabs and bud and freak out on her. After they leave i just laid out on the couch and closed my eyes and has some of the most intense visuals I've ever had. I also started thinking about my mom (who was suffering from cancer at the time) and i start coming to terms that she might not be long for this world ( turns out i was right). And i spent the rest of the night kinda exploring the inner reaches of my mind, seeing what my flaws were, reflecting on how people view me, what kinda person I really am vs who i think i am and who i wanna be. That last half of the trip helped me come to terms with a lot of stuff in my life and reoriented me in life. But definitely a world melting trip."}

My example was based on someone with no tolerance, like that was all it took my first few times. Can't recall exactly how much Walt was making off of it, but I pay $50/eighth which is probably among the lowest in the country for good stuff, prices drop off massively when you buy bulk. I have a plug that pays $800 for a QP, So I figure someone selling at Walts scale is probably making like $2000/lb, so $400,000/wk. Seems about right.

{"body":"I honestly think so, even though a lot of people  (especially harder drug users) totally dismiss and make fun of the possibility. but I've  got some reasons why I think my opinion is at least somewhat unbiased :\n\nI really, really don't like weed. I used to, in my younger teens (like 12 - 14; currently 27), think it was pretty damn cool. unfortunately I've got that \"never high enough, not euphoric enough, gimme something else to try\" thing a lot of harder drug users do. most drug classes just don't agree with me, and Rx drugs got super boring. finally landed on H as my man and later obsession, and meth as my second favorite.\n\nso I know real heavy omg-im-dying withdrawal, I swear. and I'm not deluded enough to think weed capable of causing the same feelings exactly. I thought that was total bs that pussies who'd only done weed and get a little peeved when they were out rattled off and was almost offended they'd compare it to real withdrawal. but!\n\nthen I got to watch my boyfriend, also recovered from heavier opiate/benzo/amphetamine abuse, go through - fucking weed withdrawal. now his main man, weed is like an antidepressant. his prescribed antidepressants and mood stabilizers for bipolar don't do as good a job as weed. he's likened it to running out of his Rx medicine, but worse. maybe it's not the same for non-bipolar smokers, but if he's out of weed for more than a week we can expect a bad, panicked, uncomfortably and even frighteningly overstimulated, manic episode like clockwork. because he has a low appetite naturally, and because of the psychological stress, he  feels sick and won't eat. and that makes him feel sicker, so he's even less inclined to eat. which feeds the stress, which feeds the physical sickness, which feeds the mania. it's a snowball. that motherfucker will comb through the furniture and carpet for possible bits of weed like a bad tweaker. verbally explode insults at any dealers who take their time hooking him up, or simply don't have any, like a bad junkie. it's a mess, but God damn it's real, imo for anyone using weed to medicate an existing problem - which I believe a lot of heavy smokers probably do."}

However, most people would agree that objectively, 90mg of amphetamine is a large dose in a day. 45mg per dose, twice a day is a bit much to be taking every single day (even with short weekend breaks).\n\n2. 45mg is beyond the therapeutic range for treating adhd. The only situations where this is still generally considered therapeutic is in patients who have narcolepsy.\n\n3. Once again, I think most people would agree that after taking a dose that large daily, the comedown is gonna be shit. There's no way around that when you're using that much amphetamine.\n\n4. Yes, the initial dose is 45mg but the redose is also 45mg, totalling 90mg a day. Back to point 3, that's gonna be one hell of a comedown especially with repeated use.\n\n5.

{"body":"I can't speak to Molly without any experience, but if you're going to trip alone for the first time make sure you take a smaller than normal dose. Maybe a half tab or a gram of boomers. Definitely test first.\n\nSome people have awful reactions to it, and it can bring out underlying mental illnesses in some people. Schizophrenia is a common one. Not having someone there with you to get you the help you need is risky without an idea of how you react.\n\nThere is a similar risk with many drugs, but psychedelics are a totally different beast from most things. Because there are many different ways your 8-12hr experience could go on a regular dose, it always helps to have someone around tripping with you (preferably with experience themselves) that you trust, or with someone sober and patient to ground you. In some ways it's more enjoyable to me, as having someone there throwing curve balls so I'm not fixated on one thing for long periods makes the trip more stimulating and exciting.\n\nAs an introvert, I typically prefer to trip alone, but I'm a very introspective person in general so I find self discovery journeys to be more useful and productive in a more fulfilling way than fun trips. I love both, but they have their time and place.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is be incredibly cautious until you're ready for any dose, but start slow. You'd rather \"waste\" some tabs or caps with smaller trips than deal with the fallout that is someone doing way too much their first time and having a really bad time. Stay safe bud, they're amazing but incredibly powerful, and you may see parts of you that you weren't ready for."}

Then I realized, oh fuck, I have a math test online due tonight, as well as some homework. I am not good at math by any means, especially not on a powerful dissociative, but I needed to do this stuff to pass. I do the test first while I’m still mostly sober, get a decent score. I open up the first homework, and the square in the first problem’s diagram starts telling me its life story.\n\nI listen for a while. Pretty interesting story. I snap out of it and realize I’m tripping WAY harder than I expected. Insanely hard. I keep going through the problems, getting more and more trippy and semi-delusional, listening to the stories of various geometric shapes and pressing the answer that seemed correct. First homework, done. I didn’t check my score, because my understanding of my task at that point was basically “use round thing to make pictures change on glowy box”.\n\nTime for the next homework. Repeat process from above again, only this time I begin to realize that, more than merely listening to the plights of shapes being used to outline fences, I actually am a rectangle.

{"body":"Don't be scared to start suboxone. I felt the same way for years and I regret not biting the bullet sooner. I've been doing opiates daily for about 8 or 9 years. I started with pills, then did 1mg of suboxone every day for 3 yrs. \nI started injecting dope, and because I was so afraid of the precipitated withdrawal I couldnt return to suboxone. The 4 times it has happened to me are burned into my brain. Instead I went on methadone and that was the stupidest decision ever. Please don't do that. About 8 months ago I was abruptly off the clinic and my only choices were dope or nothing. So I started doing a ton of fentanyl again whilst waiting for an opening in the suboxone clinic. Now that im adjusted to suboxone again, and on a good split dose; I'm in much better mental and physical health. I feel ligher, not as bogged down. Deffinitley have more energy,  finding that I'm not as fatigued as I had been.\n\nHeroin,methadone,oxycodone,ect. are full opioid agonists. They bind to all the MU receptors in the brain. MU receptors process the effects of opiate / opioid medications. \nSuboxone, Subutex, and Zubsolv are partial antagonists. They only bind to half of your brain's MU receptors. \nAlthough they only bind to half, they are powerful, and will viciously rip any other opiate off the mu receptors; and quickly take its place. This is what sends your body into the precipitated withdrawal. The shock of losing all the opiates the brain thinks it needs to function sends out the signals that you need more immediately and you immediately feel sicker than you have ever felt. It is not forever, it will pass; but its best to be avoided all together. \n\nYou will absolutely be able to continue your life as it is. I would recommend taking some time off for the days you will be flushing your system out before dosing the first time with suboxone. I waited 36 hours from my last shot and got precipitated withdrawal. My doctor said I'd only need to wait 24-48 hrs. If you are half as heavy of a user as I was I'd recommend waiting no less than 48 hrs before dosing. Once you get past the first week of the transition everything should be much better.  A good first dose would be 4mg. Then 1-2hrs later if you feel no better, and no worse, take another 4mg. If you feel worse stop dosing and ride out the symptoms. My begining daily dose was 12mg and that was a little to low. So I bumped it to 8mg morning \u0026amp; 8mg evening. I've been stable with that since the first day I started taking it.\nNo cravings, minor side effects you would see with any opiates.\nThe hardest part to me, is waiting it out the first couple of days. \n\nIt really is imperative you flush out the majority of the crap in your system, and be tipping the Clinicial Opiate Withdrawal Scale from moderate to severe before even glancing at your suboxone stash.\n\nBest of luck."}

Ontop, i've mixed psychs, amps, alcohol, along with benzos and opioids in the same combo. Extremely dangerous but unforgettable. Speaking from experience."}
{"body":"Your L-Tyrosine dose is quite high, I'd say for general usage surely .5-1.25g is more than enough (if not, check if you're one of the people that apparently respond better to NALT).. maybe for the day of the trip reduce the dose to just 250-500mg max as it will definitely potentiate the stimulation from the LSD quite strongly.   \n\n\nApart from that it's a very good stack overall imo, maybe look at adjusting the NAC dosage or perhaps daily timing a bit as there are some vague side effects especially with such a strong dosage but maybe irrelevant for your purposes (idk.. look into it?).  \n\n\nIf you don't have any issues with substance abuse and addiction then 1g of Phenibut after fasting (water and 'some' raw pure nootropics but nothing else consumed pretty much) for 12-14 hours.. then dosing your psychedelic of choice 1.5-3 hours after that, is absolutely phenomenal for optimising positive headspace without \"tainting\" any of the visual, spiritual or psychedelic intensity of the trip.  \n\n\nSome people report weird interactions with lions mane from time to time but you're probably gonna be all sweet."}

Also, most people don't even notice, especially if you're wearing shades and are not talking to them.\n\nA couple of years ago I was living in a campus. I was just past the peak of a strong edible, still stoned to the point where making full sentences was challenging. I was sitting in the common area with a friend that also had an edible, listening to Pink Floyd. Then this girl (that knew both of us) walked in: \"oh, hey, I used to listen to this album when I got stoned\". Us: \"... Uhh... Yeah ... It's pretty great for that\". She didn't notice a thing, we told her later, which made her laugh really hard, haha."}
{"body":"We are naturally pretty peaceful. Think about this: You've probably seen thousands of people in the past few months, and I bet you didn't try to kill or physically dominate single one of them. The vast majority of humans are like that. \n\nForaging humans have a very low birth rate because children breastfeed to 5 or 6, preventing fertility in the mother longer and causing puberty later than in agrarian cultures. This keeps population low, food plentiful, and conflict unnecessary. \n\nPolitical power became necessary after agriculture allowed human populations to grow beyond the carrying capacity of the environment. Once humans started farming, they couldn't go back. \n\nA hunter-gatherer's foraging grounds weren't all that important. When your favorite foods ran out, your band would simply move to the next atea. But a farmer's crop was worth a family's life, and control of good farmland, irrigation, and labor was worth a village. Farming is also harder than foraging. Hard labor, population density, scarcity of resources, disease, oppression, etc. pressed us to build our states and fight our wars.\n\nThe Yanomamo people of the Amazon are a good example of the pressures of agriculture."}

{"body":"if you really want to foray into hard drugs, I'd \"recommend\" crack over heroin/meth. I know a lot more people who have done crack without becoming hooked than for meth, and ESPECIALLY for heroin. The high is short, the comedown can be intense but lasts like an hour rather than days and days with meth and without meth's neurotoxicity and there are no withdrawals like opiates/heroin. The crack high is super intense but you suffer accordingly almost immediately afterwards - it's not like heroin where you can get away with using for a while with zero consequences, living on borrowed time till your first withdrawal. I wouldn't recommend crack to anyone, but I would suggest it over heroin or meth."}

{"body":"Ok. Using that as a basis, it is fine if someone uses heroin as self medication for their depression and we should not make \"fun of them\" right. Because if they have the feeling that they feel better that is fine. And we call that self medicating?\n\nAs an example: I worked in a psychiatric ward for young (male) adults with depressive episodes and some with anxiety issues.\n\nSeveral of them said at the end of the therapy, that they stopped playing video games or do it a lot less. While feeling good while playing games (/not feeling as bad as usual), it didn't actually help them but was just a distraction to ignore the rest of the world. It didn't make their lives better, it lead (beside lots of other stuff) to them staying in the depressive state because they did nothing that actually increased the quality of their life. Yet they continued because in that moment it helped.\n\nJust because you do something that makes you feel better, that doesn't mean it solves any underlying issues in the long term. It may help you cope  with your depression, but it doesn't help in treating it. And if you actually want to do that, there are various methods that are empirically backed up and normally have better chances of succes.\n\nYou should not make fun of anyone for trying ways to become happy. I do think though it is fair to point out that cannabis is a very ineffective method if you actually want to feel better in the long term, especially considering possible side effects and dangers and the existence of empirically backed up methods you could also choose. Of course that is also based on your social and cultural circumstances. In my country I can visit a psychiatry for 8 hours per day for 8 weeks (or more), without paying even 1$ for it, all while still having to be paid by my employer and not being able to be fired for being \"sick\" for 8 weeks. And since there are no \"sick days\" like in the US, there are no downsides. Same with psychotherapy which is free here. That alone makes it way easier to treat mental health problems and mostly eliminates the need for stuff like self medicating. Sadly, not everyone can do that."}

You may find it difficult to move, and may have no urge to move at all. You can fall into what is called a \"nod\" or hypnagogia, which can be described as being in between awake and asleep.

{"body":"(Feel like I over explained, but more is better than less)\n\nXanax:\nI was in my senior year at high school, only 3 months until I graduated. Having a new girlfriend introduced me to her friend group (which was nothing like her) and among other things I tried with them (cocaine +DXM) but xanax proved to be big part in the next year of my life. During that specific time, mixing all of them PLUS weed and alcohol was common, and very unsafe, but that stopped soon after.\nUse of xanax during high school was \"smart\" only doing it after school. And at this point ide \"Loved them\" but Hadn't been addicted. Out into the real world, I got a job 3 months later which gave me the funds to keep up my deadly addiction. Starting out with just .5 to get \"smacked\" off of em I quickly started taking more and more just to feel the same effects, if not to be smacked, just to not feel sick. At the peak of this, my attendance at work was suffering, relationships were suffering(impaired thinking pushed people away) and i couldn't stop loved ones from catching on. 6 bars a day (12mg) was the most I got upto\n\nSuicidal drug rage:\nDuring a trip out of state to a friends birthday, I took 9 hydroxyzene (had other problems too) and was expecting a drink or 2. When I couldn't find this, I took 1-2 xanax. 30 minutes later, a lone single beer gets discovered and i jump for it, . After mixing 10-11 pills and a beer, I was falling asleep while actively trying to eat pizza. After others taking that away, I passed out only to wake up to being smacked as hard as possible by someone. I was angry about this, not acknowledging the fact they thought I was dead, so we were there arguing. After a minute of this it went from anger, to sadness, guilt and I darted out of the house. I had seen a bridge nearby earlier that day and was heading to it, when just one minute from the bridge I heard my best friend (current girlfriend) scream in pain, and luckily hearing that through my clouded thoughts snapped me out of it. I turned back to help her\n\nOn my birthday, I planned to go into a mental hospital to get better. A week or so before this, I broke the news to my mom. She wasnt angry, because she'd been through addictions before and she believed it to be her fault. So on my birthday, I got a load of everything I could find and had a bash. At the end of my bash, my girlfriends brought me to my moms house, where an ambulance was called to bring me in. The stay I expected to last 2 weeks minimum, lasted a day.\n\n2 months later, I hit a 2 month long period of confidence and happiness which fueled my stopping them, needing to gradually lower my doses because death from withdrawl is possible. \n\n\nAfter stopping\n\nI still have friends and their parents who automatically associate my name with drugs\nFamily members treat me differently, with a bias even\nMemory problems that affect me to this day (slowly healing)\nPeople that cant accept my past if I tell them\nA tattoo to remind me of these times of struggle\n\nShort: a relapse; being lonely and hopeless 3 months after quitting, I took \u0026gt;one\u0026lt; and caught myself before getting sucked back in\n\nSorry it's so long! I over explain alot at all the wrong times I feel!\n\nSide note: there was also heavy daily marijuana use throughout all of this\n\n(Thanks for readin!)"}

Xanax can be pretty euphoric, but it is also very subtle and it's easy to not realize how fucked up you are. I would say one bar max, but everybody is different and you might be able to take more. My best advice is be patient. The isn't the kind of drug to redose because you don't think you're feeling it enough. Thats how you black out. And dont do it more than once a week. I think it's fun, but it's not worth getting addicted to, and it's highly addictive. If you don't really have alot of anxiety you might not feel it very much. Overall, just proceed with caution. 1mg and some weed, and I think you'll have a pretty good time."}

I love drugs, but I hate the drug culture that has grown up with the War on Drugs. \n\nAnother thing that sucks is it's unlikely your'e going to get quality product if you only use very infrequently, especially with H. That's just a byproduct of the hustle game that I don't have the time or incentive for. It's pretty ridiculous how America considers itself a capitalist system when a mutlibillion dollar industry is completely prohibited at the massive expense of taxpayers who are funding their own oppression. It doesn't stop at the prohibition apparatus itself, it extends to the pharmaceutical industry, the sham medical industry, the military industrial complex.

Eat right get some exercise and sleep at least 8 hrs a night. Try melatonin or valerian root to help with sleep. \n\nI also used (and continue to use) CBD isolate in pretty high doses (40 mg x2 daily).

I always advise people to not smoke for their first time, or if they really need to they should do it after they can feel the acid start to wear off.  Legit, smoking weed on the comedown basically launches you into a 2nd peak.  Smoking it when you start to peak or beforehand will always make the peak stronger."}

It's also relatively accessible in many parts of the world which makes it easy to be an addict of as it's available and a relatively safe substance.\n\nThe high at first will just feel like you're tired. The best way to use codeine is before bed, so you nodd in and out of your high and pass out to the next morning. I would also take one toke of cannabis, but not more.

{"body":"I thought like this not even that long ago, I've mentioned this numerous times but I'm currently in recovery from a 15 year heroin and crack addiction.  During that time I would also do almost any other drug that was available.  I took cocaine for the first time when I was 11/12 and have took one drug or another constantly from then till literally last month (I'm 38 now) So almost 3/4 of my life I've been on some kind of drug as well as drinking alcohol.  One of my big concerns when I was deciding to try and get clean was that I didn't know what I would do to fill all the free time I would have, and how I would cope with having to deal with just getting through my days with a sober head on me, and how I'd have to actually deal with my problems instead of getting high to forget about them.  I've found that it's in no way as bad as I thought it would be, in fact it's actually awesome as I no longer have to go through that thing when you wake up in the morning and have that feeling of sort of regret that you're not 100% sure what you did the previous night. Now, sober I know that although obviously I won't always make the right choice, at least I now know that any decision I now make was made with a straight head and (hopefully) well intended, so I'm not now constantly full of regret and always apologising to people over my action when I was under the influence of something. You think that you'll be miserable not being able to drink or smoke but in my experience it's not like that, you just end up appreciating and enjoying things/life from a different sort of perspective.

{"body":"A handful of the more extreme RNC member reps in our state legislation ran away to avoid being forced to vote on something that they didn't like but was guaranteed to pass. Various neo-nazi groups voiced their support, threatened to commit mass assault and murder at the capitol if the vote happened, and one cowardly hiding rep voiced his approval of said support.\n\nThe vote was for increased environmental protections from neonics, the pesticide that is causing all the bees to die off. This pissed of the nazis for some reason, they must inject it to get high or something.\n\nI am ashamed to say that rather than calling in the militia (the biggest and most well armed in the nation) and guarding the legislation while they held the vote (eventually enough truant reps were dragged in to form a quorum and vote), or rather than declaring that the truant reps had abdicated their duty and abandoned their post, meaning they quit their jobs as legislators and thus no longer have the right to vote, so the legislation doesn't need to wait, no rather than either of those, the governor backed down and simply rescheduled the vote.\n\nGranted, that was the de-escalating way to handle it... but it didn't resolve the problem, just push it back. Now the nazis think they can dictate our democracy; they will do this shit again, just like they continue to show up and \"protest\" us, because they have gotten away with it in the past. \n\nWould have been better to call in the militia, and have them put down the armed out of state terror group that is attacking us and our government. A show of force and that we will not be intimidated would go a long way toward making these fuckwads think twice about coming here to attack us.\n\nNow when the inevitable confrontation comes, it will be even bigger, because the terror groups just keep pushing the boundaries of what they can get away with."}

It seems to \"cure\" my depersonalization too which I used to have. I can somewhat feel like how you described after a bad LSD trip though, especially the lack of friendliness. But never with psilocybin. The dose you took probably could have been better as well. Next time if you do it I would go for 1 single gram or 3 grams just by yourself. 2g can feel pretty weird because it's in this strange like intermediate \"between\" stage between real tripping and low level tripping. A dose of 1.5 -2g also typically gives me a much more prolonged bout of come-up anxiety. For me the only unpleasant part is the come-up.

{"body":"Any drug you take will alter your brain, including caffeine. Meditation also alters the brain, and so does literally everything you do. Cannabis alters the way your brain functions while you are high, and also during the phase when you initally stop and your brain has to start making its own cannabis again. This being said, Weed will NOT permanently alter the way your brain works, and if you're worried about your use, try taking a week long T break and decide if you want to stick with it or not.\n\nFor the first couple days you can expect some insomnia, sweating, and irritability, but this doesn't happen for a lot of people and I seem to be especially prone to this. I've been taking cannabis on and off for around two years, and my tolerance is still right where it was when I started because I take frequent breaks. The studies that involve behavior alterations and development issues like you talk about are on children aged 11-14, and you're well above that range. This doesn't mean smoke as much weed as you want though, just try to figure out the best way to work it into your life. The first time I smoked I was worried about the exact same shit, but the dependency threshold for THC is lower than coffee. I worry more about how much caffeine I have than how much I smoke."}

They may include:\n\nRunny nose, aches, pains, headache\nIrritability, jitteriness, apathy\nA lack of energy, mild body temperature increase\nSymptoms can be exacerbated if cocaine was used with alcohol or some other substance.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms are often very distressing for individuals. Many times, people will resort to potentially dangerous ways of dealing with them.\n\nWHAT NOT TO DO\nThere are probably as many different types of so-called “cures” for hangovers as there are different symptoms for specific substances of abuse.

But dog's metabolize it very slowly allowing the toxic to build. High amounts of theobromine can produce muscle tremors, seizures, an irregular heartbeat, internal bleeding or a heart attack. So I don't understand why you even brought it up.\n\nThe elephant was given 297 000 ug of acid and went into a epileptic seizure which resulted in suffocation because of spasm. The elephant was chosen for the experiment because they have very similar brains as us, so what happened to the elephant would happen to us. But no one would volunteerly take such a high dosage, you'd have to drink several bottles of acid to get close to 297 000 ug."}

I stopped and made eye contact with myself for a long long time.

{"body":"Tried to off myself with hydros, Xanax, and alcohol one time. Didn't get very far because I passed out about 3 pills in and didn't even finish off my beer. Apparently, someone found me in that state and took the pills and shit. I was incredibly fucked off when I woke up because I didn't expect to still be alive. Found a hydro laying in my bed that was missed during the cleanup I guess. Being in the mental state I was in, I popped it without thinking twice. I felt it distinctly. It was calming beyond belief and I felt a little out of it while it was running its course. I didn't personally find it addicting. I prefer my recreational drugs with a little more dissociation, and hydros simply didn't do that. Not my kind of high. If you're curious, try it. If you've already made up your mind, there's nothing I can say that'll stop you anyway. Just be safe with it and don't let it consume your life."}

{"body":"I would not recommend eating only sugar - the sugar in your blood will go up very quickly, but then also down very quickly and you will feel even more hungry. Maybe eating a good, protein rich meal before you take speed and then if you are hungry drinking the protein shake/eating a protein bar or smth. (now yeah, just take the protein drink but without sugar) \nI recommend keeping stuff like protein drinks, protein bars or rice cakes (those might have the same sugar high-sugar low effect I described, but they last forever and fill an empty and upset stomach nicely). \n\nAlso it sounds to me like you might have unbalanced diet. Try to look into healthy diet, eat your share of vegetables and protein and this problem might disappear. \n\nAnyway good luck with that!"}

{"body":"If you haven’t done this convo then don’t comment because you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about. Dmt: 15-20 mins max, lsd: 12-15 hours or more. So, no it isn’t a waste of either drug. \n\nTo answer OP: I did that combo plus ket and 2CB and it felt great. I was about 9 hours into the lsd and the night was ending of the festival and so we decided to crack open the dmt. I had my first breakthrough and then had another straight after. Haven’t managed to do it since as my dealer is at uni but I can’t wait to try again, was my favourite psychedelic experience bar none. The combo of the other drugs made me accept the entities to show me into my mind where before I had rejected it, leading to a bad dmt trip the second time I tried the drug. \n\nI’d actually recommend combining dmt with other drugs to make breakthroughs smoother and easier. Dmt is so strong you essentially experience the dmt visuals for the 15 minutes or so regardless of what you’re on before, but other drugs (like k and acid) make it easier to accept what’s happening/you need less to breakthrough. \n\nAgain, these are two very ignorant comments. You won’t have a “mental breakdown” unless you’d have one from acid anyway."}

{"body":"I’m a sex trafficking survivor and one of the things a recovery program I worked talks about is the expansion and shrinking of our “boundary box,” like the kind of behavior we are willing to accept from ourselves (and others). That was a really helpful concept for me to learn. As both an addict and someone who grew up in the game, expanding the boundary box was always “cool” and “desirable” to me because it meant I was slick, experienced, not being gullible, not letting anyone get over on me, etc. Part of recovery from both the life and addiction has been realizing that in normal life people are not supposed to relate that way, and that if I want honesty, trust, no manipulation, etc. I have to be able to practice it, too. Working the steps helps me with that. The truth is most squares are not manipulative dicks and shrinking your boundary box has more upsides than downsides. It also is the only way to build genuine connection with others which is necessary to get and stay sober."}

Shroom visuals are way less intense and darker/deeper in nature, plus the headspace is more fucky and introspective. Hence why i havent tried it with mdma yet.\n\nI get a TON of anxiety right before dropping the mdma though.

Also lisdexamphetamine is a pro drug so its 100% metabolized into dextroamphetamine the lis prefix is just there bc of another chemical there to stop people from snorting it or methods other than taking it orally.  My psychiatrist just started me on vyvanse yesterday and tommorow is gonna be the 3rd day so i doubt im gonna have much tolerance. Only problem with vyvanse is it doesnt really help me concentrate like adderall which is why im perscribed it in the first place. Just figured that my perscription is for every day of the month i might as well not take it and save it when im not going to be doing work."}

{"body":"Thanks mate, and sorry for the delay in replying.  This is gonna sound a bit bad but in the long run it's probably better that you're finding it hard now as when i'd only been on its year or 2, I got myself some subotex and decided to quit. I took an 8 mil tablet the first day, 4 mil the next I was good for 2 days after that then I took 2 mil missed a day then took one more 2 mil tablet and that was it I didn't need to do anything else.  I stayed clean for a few weeks after that, then I started thinking that getting clean is easy so I could smoke a bit hear and there and if i get hooked again it'll be easy for me to get myself clean again!! Boy was I wrong, for the next about 12/13 years I unsuccessfully tried to quit not even managing to go just 1 week clean.  It's only now, after pretty much loosing everything - jobs, relationships, homes, pretty much all of my personally possessions even causing my parents to get right on the verge of having to sell their house because of me (I know I can't ever fully be forgiven for forcing them into that position, but thanks to me managing to get a pretty well paid job in just one month ((although one TOUGH month)) we've thankfully been able to get it so they are no longer in that position) I've managed to get clean.  Like i said i know it sounds bad saying its for the best you're finding it hard, as if you found it easy you might think like i did that you can have the occasionally smoke as even if you get addicted again you can easily quit.  As it is now the memory of how hard it's been will be another reason to stay clean.  Congrats on getting clean though mate thats awesome, and same goes to you mate if you ever wanna talk feel free to get in touch"}

{"body":"Either. I don't really care."}
{"body":"Kratom is a leaf from Southeast Asia that has opioid properties but much milder than traditional opiates. It produces a feeling of wellbeing and has painkilling properties. If you have no tolerance it can produce euphoria as well. \n\nAnd you don’t get fucked up on it; you remain relatively sober while feeling great. \n\nHowever, it can be addictive, so proceed with caution.

Ive done it over 80 times (not counting microdosing) at doses from 50ug all the way to up about 2000ug. I have had many life changing, spiritual experiences and have learned a lot from the drug. It made me who i am today. But I have also gotten to the point with LSD that I dont gain much from it, and I almost feel sober mentally because I am so used to the headspace. I don't get spiritual experiences much anymore. \n\nBecause of that, most of my trips nowadays are purely for fun. I dont take it at parties, but i have at shows/festivals and I am not a big fan. However, I love to take it and do nothing but listen to my new playlists, hang out with friends, and smoke a retarded amount of weed. I also love mixing it with MDMA and nitrous for purely recreational purposes. It makes for a very fun, colorful, lively experience and I see nothing wrong with that. I also love drinking on LSD.\n\nRecreational LSD use is perfectly okay, and is very fun. Just dont abuse it.\n\nIf we were talking about DMT or ayahuasca, I would disagree tho."}

I am prescribed 1.5 (0.5mg 3x daily) of Clonazepam; have been on and off for years. Even this dosage never has made me feel intoxicated or \"high\"\\~your son is definitely taking probably larger doses of these benzodiazepine meds and the thing about them is that if he has built a tolerance to them you can't just take them from him and make his body cold-turkey. Abruptly stopping any of the meds that you have mentioned could have some serious adverse reaction, and depending on the severity can cause seizures. Alcohol withdrawals and benzodiazepine withdrawals are the only two drug withdrawals that do have lethal potential due to the risk of seizures. Scary stuff, quite honestly.

{"body":"Ok going to try to help you out here.  Read a good bit of judging and just not much advice or insight.  Of course, you have to work, can't watch him all day and even if you didn't work and stayed home, he would find ways to avoid you and fool you, being an addict as he is.  His Dad dying at 1 is tough and whatever else he has had to deal with besides the depression which is enough to make anyone feel different and use drugs or not want to get a job and leave the house or do anything but play video games and watch movies + probably masturbate a good bit.  Thing is for a depressed person who wants to be left alone and avoid people, every once in a while it's comforting to have someone around just so you don't feel truly dead.  On the other hand, if they're there to watch you and keep track of what you're doing it might make him more anxious and depressed and then want to rebel away from the house and get in trouble with the law and anything else.  Have to think about whats best for his mental health (he needs a new doctor to get him on the right meds so he feels better and won't want to buy random meds to abuse, although he still might try to even so) um...rehab yeah it's good...for a month or two...then right back to the same situation so right back to the same habits that make you worry...you can't stop it, control it, the more you do the worse it might get so just offer him any type of help he might need that leads to more positive activities and actions and eventually he might get bored enough to try them and there's a chain reaction just like the physics of depression an object at rest stays at rest basically.  What you could do which he probably won't like too much because he's comfortable with living with you and doing what he wants (besides the person hired to watch him, which honestly is just a waste of your money and not going to help him or you whatsoever since he's 21 and not 10 or younger) so...you could...send him to a sober house/halfway house to live after rehab so his sobriety is continued if you can afford to pay for it or if not even just to help him out temporarily until he finds a job thru a connection at the house or someone in the program.  Not much you can truly do but continue to love him and try not to mess with him mental health while promoting positive ideas whenever you can and telling him you are sorry that he's depressed and you want him to live and it's ok that he's not happy.  Don't make yourself crazy over it like you already did hiring someone to watch him and this...just relax and know it's going to be a long slow uphill battle with mental health/addiction issues and since you love him you won't give up and hopefully he won't either."}

The northern region of my country is filled with picturesque landscapes and natural beauty so we decided to go and drop acid there.\nIt was the 4th day of our trip, we were 5 guys and dropped 300ug each. The thing is that one of my friend hadn't taken a shit since the last 4 days.\nSo I told him to go and take a dump in the nature.\nBeing reluctant at first, he grabbed a water bottle and went to a seculded area. This was about 40mins after we had dropped acid.\n15 more mins later, he comes back with a dead serious look on his face.\nI asked him that what was up.\nHe was struggling at first but then he told us.\n\"An insect went up my ass when I was taking a shit.\"\nWe laughed like motherfuckers.\nHowever I quickly noticed that he was dead serious and was starting to take on a bad trip.\nI took him away from my other friends because they couldn't stop laughing but I don't blame them.\nAfter telling him that it was all in his mind, he was still adamant and paranoid to an extent that he sat down-dipping his butt cheeks- in the cold river stream to get the \"insect\" out.\nThe only way I calmed him down was by lying to him saying that the same thing happened to me before and the feeling will go away eventually."}

It’s not a 1:1, of course, since the psychological and financial issues of cocaine addiction are far more harmful in the short term than alcohol addiction is (from my experience), but they’re at similar levels.\n\nI definitely think that cocaine is the most expensive addiction one could have. Heroin comes close, but heroin has a relatively long duration of action before you start getting withdrawals, unlike cocaine. In any case, addiction to it seems to run in my family so I’m staying far away from it."}

{"body":"False. I'm sure a lot of people would not try meth if they knew it was neurotoxic. And amphetamine has not been found to be neurotoxic at all, just because it can be addictive does not mean it is toxic- meth has been found to be directly toxic and can destroy parts of brain cells. A low dose of meth could be similar to a medium or high dose of amphetamine- so if people have the choice they should chose the amphetamine because it is safer."}

{"body":"Mid 2nd plateau would probably take about 400mg to 450mg, or in other words roughly around two thirds of a 600mg bottle.  \n\nIf you weigh 90kg, you might need to take a tiny bit more in order to achieve effects, due to metabolism. \n\nEating is fine, it will just delay your metabolism a bit, i like to eat before i take it. When ingesting the cough syrup, be aware that it can make you puke especially if you drink a lot. So if you can't chug it, then try to sip on it, DXM stays in the system for a long time before it is cleared out. I sometimes spend 5 to 6 hours sipping my robitussin, it does weaken the effects a little but not much especially if you only spend like a few hours or less sipping it. \n\nBest things to do while tripping on DXM? On 400mg of DXM, the best thing to do would probably be to listen to music in your livingroom or bedroom. At night. Light on if it is in your living room, more trippy that way. But lights off if it is your bedroom, cause on DXM darkness can be amazing. You'll be on another planet lol, getting sucked through the different dimensions. One cool thing about DXM is that it overwhelms you with a never-ending sense of deep wonder, so you can sit in the same room all day and never get bored. And music is amazing. When you are experienced at hallucinogens, and if you can act sober, then DXM is an amazing drug for going to supermarkets and warehouses and stuff. \n\nAt the mid-second plateau, you will feel very stoned. Not super stoned, but still very high. But obviously it is still very different to weed. DXM feels very dissociative, kind of like the dissociative vibes from weed but much stronger and weirder. Everything will feel kind of like you are drunk, but not in the warm comforting way like alcohol, more like a cool chilling out way like your mind is inside a refridgerator. You will experience some significant ego loss, but you will still be able to think fairly well. At the mid 2nd plateau, your CEV's will start to take more shape and become more manifested. They come towards you, strange structures and exotic realms that are bursting with beautiful dreamy  nostalgia. You may even see faint dreamlike worlds, that dont become very apparent until the 3rd plateau. On the mid 2nd plateau, you will feel like you have left the shallow end of the pool and are entering a deeper realm.  \n\nDXM is a dissociative, so it detatches you from everything. While socializing can be fun, especially on the lower doses, DXM is more of an \"explore the universe on your own\" kind of drug. Not so much a party drug."}

In the case of MDMA, it is MDMA.HCl, amphetamine is usually amphetamine.H*_2_*SO*_4_* and LSD is LSD.tartrate.  Because these forms are ubiquitous, nobody bothers to mention the second bit because it's irrelevant. All doses you see for MDMA are referring to the HCl salt, which means that MDMA which is sold as \"the purest you can get, 84%\", is treated as 100% pure.\n\nThe reason sellers do this is because they usually *don't* have very pure MDMA, and they **want** people to make the mistake you have made and take more to account for crappy product. It is dishonest, confusing and misleading and if you have a choice you should avoid this vendor.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"Congrats bro I’m 7 months almost 8 months clean off of every single drug I was using every drug everyday I would do a shit load of coke then I would start snorting Opanas then drop 8-10 hits if lsd then go to Xanax then pcp all in less than an hour every single day. The first week is awful getting off opioids and everything goes downhill but trust me man after the first 3-4 months things start to get better. Relapse happens to all of us but this was the first time I’ve actually tried to get clean and I went to rehab then my parents forced me into another 4 month program and honestly I couldn’t be more thankful because having to go into a long term rehab is honestly better. You build up a huge foundation on how to stay clean and how to try and stay away from all the people you used with. I know that 85% of the people I was with either relapsed or they’re dead now but it happens and it shows you that it can happen to anyone even the people who take recovery seriously and they’re all about it. It’s different for everyone you can dive in it and go all out right as soon as you get in but almost if the time you get overwhelmed and then go back to using (that’s from what I’ve seen and from what I’ve heard from people who have relapsed) they all said go in at your own pace everyone is different.

Honestly, if you're going to hire someone to watch him and try to make sure he does not do drugs while you're gone, should hire him a hot woman to treat him nice and make him feel more like a man, will do wonders for his depression and mental health way more than like an authority figure trying to control him (in his mind) ....forgot to post this previously, sorry."}

Odds are if something happened and you had to go to the ER they would have no fucking clue what to do because they've never seen someone mix Vyvanse and kratom. \n\nI once read an article that said \" There are no published human pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, or drug interaction studies on kratom or mitragynine, making it virtually impossible to fully understand kratom’s therapeutic potential and risks and the populations most likely to benefit or experience harm from its use. \"\n\n [https://academic.oup.com/ajhp/article/75/5/261/5102317](https://academic.oup.com/ajhp/article/75/5/261/5102317) \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso go to fucking CVS and test your blood pressure if you're worried about it...

{"body":"This isn't some methed up story full of hookers and shootouts, but it's pretty funny.  I've smoked the reefer for a long time, and about 10 years ago I was at my favorite rolling spot.  It was a gravel access road in the woods that dead ended into a creek. There was something down there the water department needed access to, so that's why this road existed.  You could continue into the creek, and climb up a hill to the other side, and find yourself on a gravel road running parallel to the creek.  \n\nThe first few years i spent riding 4 wheelers and trucks back in this area was great. Had a creek, hill climbs, and plenty of mud. Had access to probably 40 or 50 acres of trails on the other side of the creek. But the city was exploding, and every inch of dirt available was being bought up and built on. What was once our peice of paradise, is now a wal mart, 500 unit apartment complexes, a home depot, 50 restaurants, and a bunch of other stores of all kinds.  Basically we had about 5 acres left on this side of the creek to 4 wheel, the rest was now hustling and bustling.  \n\nMy normal routine was to park at the end of this gravel road in the woods, listen to the creek and twist one up.  So here I am breaking up my stuff on a CD case.  I get about halfway through this process, and on the other side of the creek at the top of the embankment looking down at me are two cyclist.  Nothing too strange, people around here all the time.  They're up at the top of the hill (about 8' tall) talking, pointing at me and laughing. Still doesn't seem to odd, couple of fitness guys laughing at a stoner.  Then I noticed they matched, exactly. Same helmets, same sunglasses, same white shirts, same gloves etc...  Then I remembered my bustling town had recently added bicycle cops.  I had never seen them before, but my buddy said he saw them riding around town, with white uniforms instead of navy blue like the rest of the police.  In my young arrogance, thinking I was in front of civilians exercising, I had split the skin, emptied the guts next to the truck, and filled it up while these guys were watching me. As I'm licking and twisting this this, I notice one of them reach over to his shoulder, grab his Mic, and start speaking into it. That's when it hits me.  Fucking Cops!!! The cops in this town are notorious for going overboard on eeeeeverything.  Also, I've had plenty of run ins with them. Not for drugs, mainly fast cars and a heavy foot, but we're not pals.  Instantly I crank the radio full blast, I'm not giving them a chance to identify themselves.  I'm also now about halfway through my 180 degree spin as I'm flinging gravel and dirt halfway to heaven.  I caught them off guard, because I could see in my rearview they were hesitating to come barreling down the embankment after me, pointing and hollering at each other.  \n\nMy heart is fixing to bust out of my chest, I don't know if I'm technically fleeing and Evading, I've got drugs on me, and I'm essentially trapped like a rat in a cage.  This gravel road is in a neighborhood, with one way in and one way out, and I'm at the back of this neighborhood.  Luckily I live about a half mile from the gravel road in this neighborhood. \n\nThis gravel road comes off a culdesac.  You turn left out of the culdesac onto a side street, then you are at the main road for the neighborhood.  Now coming down this main road, if you know where to look, you can just barely see the gravel road I was on where it meets the creek.  The timing of how this worked out is still incredible to me.  I was in a lifted maroon truck covered in mud.  I didn't fit in with the suburb I was in.  As I turn left onto the main road, my heart drops.  My towns finest is doing an easy 75mph down the main road in the neighborhood, heading right towards me.  Fucking busted.  Except he doesn't see me.  He is looking to the right and completely focused on trying to peer through that one opening in the woods that would let him see the spot I was sitting at rolling up my smoke.  I literally cruise right by him, completely dumbfounded at how this is playing out.  The road we are on is straight for a half mile.  If I didn't pull out at the exact second I had, he would have been looking straight.  I must have appeared in his field of vision the instant that he began looking to his right.  I could hear his tires squealing as he made the turn towards where I had just been.  Luckily the road to my house was about 1000' from where I passed this cop.  I hauled ass, almost took out the house trying to get in the garage, and slammed the door shut.  The next 20 minutes were spent hiding my remaining 4 grams, and shutting the blinds and hanging sheets over the windows in the garage like I'm America's Most Wanted.  Don't know if a blunt will ever taste as good as that one did, talk about satisfying. \n\nTLDR, I rolled a blunt in front of 2 cops that I didn't know were cops, and escaped because 3rd cop in route to crime scene was trying to locate me through the woods as he drove right past me."}

{"body":"The concept of karma and Dharma. Imagine it like a kind of fate. According to this,(loosely and very abbreviated) everything that happens to us happens for a reason. Either to punish or reward us for something we did. Either way it is supposed to teach us something.\n\nOver the course of our lives, all the experiences we have teach us a specific thing that we need in our lives. Monks spending decades meditating is the price they pay for the Divine knowledge. Putting a piece of paper on your tongue is skipping that intense process. We don't value the knowledge given to us as much because we didn't sacrifice for it. Everything has a price. Everything has a counter balance. I imagine monks are permanent in their power while I always find that a couple months after acid or shrooms I revert back to my old thought processes unconsciously. But hey maybe that's just me.\n\nOf course the argument can be made that taking the drug in the first place is part of your karma. I get that. That's how I try to rationalize it to myself. But it still feels like unearned knowledge.\n\nYes drugs put me on the path of spirituality but I think about it sometimes. What if I wasn't ready to be on that path yet. What if there was more I had to learn?"}

{"body":"Sertraline (100mg at night currently, initially 200mg): 7-10 most effective in treating anxiety overall, a few drawbacks mainly lack of sex drive but nothing I can’t live with. Honestly no real qualms about being on it, going on 7 years. I feel like a decently normal human being on it. Never went through withdrawal. \n\nGabapentin (600-900mg a day currently, started at 300mg): 5-10 great for sleep, but if I don’t take at least half the dose each night I don’t sleep at all. Helps with chronic pain from repetitive stress in the joints. Helps to take in advance of stressful events to avoid panic but not useful in the midst of an urgent panic attack, takes like an hour to kick in. Never went through withdrawal. Been on it for 4 years. \n\nSaphris 10mg: 3-10 made me wake up in night sweats while adjusting, knocked me out cold. Tastes bad. Over time as my body adjusted I slept well and wasn’t so fatigued,  it was still noticeably more tired than normal and in a constant state of mild dissociation from my surroundings. Described for anxiety despite being a strong antipsychotic. Withdrawal was very rough. Feelings of strong vertigo and some brain shocks. Panic attacks were common. No sleep. Numbed me during a traumatic life event but would never recommend for anxiety. Had to taper off 1mg at a time, 2 week breaks in between drops. Was on it for 2 years, took 1 year of effort to wean off safely. \n\nLorazepam 6mg a day: 4-10 highly addictive. Only reason I don’t give it a 1-10 for all the shit it put me me through is because of how addictive I found it. I still have some in my closet just to have it. Psychiatrist started me at a heavy dose during trauma of six 1mg tablets per day. Was on that initial dose steadily for 6 months. Relief from anxiety within a minute or two. Dissociated, no fucks given, blank mind space, social, made you noticeably more drunk. Great sleep. Not for long term relief. Worst withdrawal experience. Terrifying brain shocks, heavy vertigo, panic attacks, jaw clenching, shaken eyesight, shit sleep, suicidal ideation, self harming behavior. Cut each small pill into 1/6ths before I could get off. Took about 3.5 years to wean off, still slip-ups now and then, maybe 5 times a year. Only halves at a time."}

Smoke in any form either from weed, tobacco, a campfire, a burning building, smoke is smoke it’s not good for your lungs or cardiovascular health. Switch to a different form of ingestion vaping eating tinctures etc. But still see a doctor it won’t hurt anything to make sure your heart and lungs are healthy what you felt wasn’t normal."}
{"body":"My stepfathers sister died because of alcohol a few months ago. Raging alcoholic but reduced her drinking quite alot jn her last months. It still didn’t matter in the end. Had a total organ failure and basically all blood vessels in her body ruptured. She bled out in full fucking agony. She became psychotic and verbally abused her three children all day long because of alcohol. I could tell this story all day long, but nobody would give a shit and would start getting blackout drunk the next weekend.\n\n\nYet I am the „trash drug addict“ with a „super unhealthy“ lifestyle because I piss positive for THC. My psychiatrist I visit for (now mild) depression has absolutely zero worries about me vaping weed once a month, yet everyone (except my parents) would lose their absolute shit if they found out. My snooping employer luckily has saliva tests which don’t detect THC for very long, but I wouldn’t get help like a alcoholic would get. Ironically they even had a fucking wine cellar and sauna for the somewhat higher ups. Fucking joke.

Go to your doctor and tell them how much you drink and they can tell you if you need help with the withdrawals or not. \n\nIf you are a serious drinker, you cannot come off alcohol without benzos. They aren't taken to \"numb\" things. They are necessary to stop seizures, DT's, tachycardia, fever, sweating and all the other shit that happens when you withdrawal."}

I can’t smoke any bud to comedown because it just makes it worse until the coke high comes down, which is typically around 8-9 AM when the suns already shining bright and birds are out chirping.

In the bottom level, the air was pure NOs, a sorta hell. At the top level, the bourgeoisie of this universe, they had clean oxygen.\n\nOne of my friend w major polyaddiction issues reigned supreme over the pure NOs hell level, yelling to me, while I was sitting in one of the middle levels, that I needed to savor the precious NOs by holding it in, prompting me to hold my breath, like my friend saw me do.\n\nAlso, there was a news broadcaster reporting live from the infamous NOs Universe.\n\nIt was well weird.

I remember thinking during that trip that I prob won’t remember it after and i quite literally remember almost nothing from it apart from how intense it was and there was also lots of euphoria. I’ve done loads of psychedelics and other drugs ever since and I’ve never come close to that level of tripping, probably because I zoned out that time and I would prob have to take a scary amount of acid or shrooms to zone out like that, but that would be a totally different story ��\n\nThat goes to show that crazy shit can happen from weed and it doesn’t really matter whether it’s edibles or not, it all depends on how hard it hits you"}

In the begining of the industrial revolution you are right that something changed with Francis Bacon, to him Nature and Man are two different things, Nature is a conquest (like land and women, yes he was a dick). Hopefully (and psychedelics helped in this conception in the 60'), we are going back to an unitary vision, which is part of the ecological movement. We have a lot of constructs for animals, seems weird sometimes, but it's us as animals. It's ok to be some kind of super fucked up monkeys, more complex, and still very ignorant at the same time.

{"body":"Yes they do have an interaction with opiates. Combining two cns depressants can lead to respiratory depression which means you can stop breathing. That means don’t drink on them too. Also benzos are a very slippery slope man. They help with depression. A lot. They help because they make you forget about your problems. But that doesn’t make them go away. One day you’ll still have to face those problems and this time your gonna have an addiction along with them. I abused benzos very heavily to forget about my problems. Don’t be like me man.

{"body":"thanks this is the advice i was looking for"}
{"body":"Warning a bit long. Yeah I can understand that fear. It's definitely not for some people and can show you some extremely strange inexplicable shit. I get it sometimes but I'm just a Nitrous fiend and besides maybe being a delusional/psychotic I truly, in my soul, in my being, believe there's something to be found within Nitrous especially with how consistent it becomes after a certain point. It's like at first it's a bit underwhelming, then random, fun, interesting, maybe a bit scary, and then starts getting deep and abstract. And then only continues on from there seemingly stopping each time you stop and starting at the same point once you pick it back up.\n\nIt's literally like every nitrous trip I've ever done, ever *will do*, or probably even ones a \"higher dimension me\" has done leaves imprinted memories in place in the world in like some inbetween dimension or some shit. I can actually tap into it without psychs if I just use Meth (high Dopamine and possibly the help of the Serotonin effects like psychs and such) or even a bit of THC Oil. But every time I take Nitrous, BOOM! My room and reality is filled with those colorful vibrations/fibers/lines which seemingly contain experiences I've had, will probably have, or as I mentioned memories from a \"higher self\" if that exists (which to me I believe \"our individual realities\" are actually contained within like a fractaling ladder of dimensions. Which I've only ever really seen on Nitrous especially with LSD where it's like I didn't break through certain times because another version of me's awareness was distracted/wasn't active/aware of me trying to sorta climb the ladder.\n\nI remember an experience basically being shot to the immediate top of the ladder and freaking out with zero control of my physical self (felt like my consciousness shattered into these various realities and my vision went blank) and then fishing out/almost having a seizure. I literally came to having hurt myself a bit (hit my tailbone) and remember a glimpse of what I saw which was like this vision of endless realities/alternate me's and maybe other people. I basically became everything, everyone, all there is/was/will be, because apparently at the top of the ladder is being everything, every sensation, every person, every memory, all of time, yin and yang. Which would explain my seizure like experience since human brains are too limited to experience literally EVERYTHING all at once. But somehow I survived it with pieces of it still in mind because, in my head (and in some of my experiences it was \"explained to me\") that my higher self knew I was on my way to figuring things out and somehow sent over the seizure to another me who subsequently died or something (hard to explain and go into detail since it's very....potentially psychosis filled I suppose).\n\nAnd since then have had some intense deja vu experiences downright remembering these experiences as having happened yet looking at the date and being confused as to when those events could have ever occurred if not only recently. And the ones I remember somehow have some minor changes in comparison that I remember during the \"new\" experience which really made me question reality and what was happening. Like I'll be oh yeah yeah yeah this happened last time and then I go through it but it's slightly different. And I'm like wait, when did this happen???\n\nThen today did some more Nitrous and basically got the conclusion that there really is a higher dimension that's very hard to reach unless you tap into \"yourself\" and their mind/awareness and somehow go there? All I know is that alternate reality is VIVID AS FUCK. Like this reality is what maybe 1080p - 1440p, High, 120fps with glitches and bugs. But that glimpse I had of the new one instead of seeing the individual strands of reality (each one a color on the spectrum all coming from white light which is what makes up our reality) it was like seeing water. Just clear, vivid, smooth, flowing reality. Basically 4K, Ultra, 240fps + G-Sync. Shit was smooth as silk and amazing and felt like you have total control of your mind and body yet I couldn't stay there. I only ever get glimpses of it in terms of visual clarity (sometimes a good dose of Meth, LSD, or sometimes Nitrous I'll somehow be able to see extra depth) and hearing where it's like the sound is inside me yet surrounds the whole world and also makes me move to beat almost perfectly like I become the music itself.\n\nAnd at one point in my trip I basically became all there ever was in my reality. Like everything is contained within me and my memories and nothing else until shortly after I came to and was relieved everything was still normal. But it did sorta teach me that yeah we're all the same thing, consciousness. And that each of us is our own individual reality containing our own models of other people within it and from our individual perspectives we're all there is. Which is still true, we are all different yet the same, we are many yet one, and we just *are*. We just sense and experience and make something out of it. Together we are all there is like a god with schizophrenia and multiple personalities. Experiencing ourselves from various abstract perspectives. I also learned something about how life is the way it is so that we can *be*, see and feel ourselves in other people, and feel pleasure and love (with the opposites there to *truly* understand the meaning and feeling of pleasure and love) and novelty. Entropy and newness. Without them life wouldn't be worth it."}

{"body":"HPPD is a hypersensitivity to external stimuli. Drugs increase sensation and some time turns up the dials a little too much.\n\nThe things we see with HPPD - are normal. Floaters - you will see them, they are always there but you are sensitive. White/black dots in vision - in bright environments you may be able to see your own cells in your vision. Visual static - no one has a concrete answer for this, but some professionals have speculated everyone sees some degree of it, but our use of drugs has exacerbated it. \n\nThe literal only thing that is going to help you is #1 - stop focusing on it; when you stop focusing it literally feels like it’s not there.\n\n#2 - Healthy foods and exercise, your body cannot function correctly if you aren’t getting your correct fibers, fats, proteins along with all the required vitamins and nutrients.\n\n#3 - make sure you’re sleeping enough and lay off drugs. Sleep is essential for the function of your body. Single handily the most important function of the human body past maintaining dietary needs."}

{"body":"The adverse side effects of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of substance consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious adverse drug effects than dosages used for therapeutic purposes.\n\nPhysical\n\nAt normal therapeutic doses, the physical side effects of amphetamine vary widely by age and from person to person. Cardiovascular side effects can include hypertension or hypotension from a vasovagal response, Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the hands and feet), and tachycardia (increased heart rate). Sexual side effects in males may include erectile dysfunction, frequent erections, or prolonged erections. Gastrointestinal side effects may include abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea. Other potential physical side effects include appetite loss, blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced seizure threshold, tics (a type of movement disorder), and weight loss. Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses.\n\nAmphetamine stimulates the medullary respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In a normal person at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect can be useful in treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.\n\nUSFDA-commissioned studies from 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease.\n\nPsychological\n\nAt normal therapeutic doses, the most common psychological side effects of amphetamine include increased alertness, apprehension, concentration, initiative, self-confidence and sociability, mood swings (elated mood followed by mildly depressed mood), insomnia or wakefulness, and decreased sense of fatigue. Less common side effects include anxiety, change in libido, grandiosity, irritability, repetitive or obsessive behaviors, and restlessness; these effects depend on the user's personality and current mental state. Amphetamine psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) can occur in heavy users. Although very rare, this psychosis can also occur at therapeutic doses during long-term therapy. According to the USFDA, \"there is no systematic evidence\" that stimulants produce aggressive behavior or hostility.\n\nAmphetamine has also been shown to produce a conditioned place preference in humans taking therapeutic doses, meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used amphetamine.\n\nReinforcement disorders\n\nAddiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses; in fact, lifetime stimulant therapy for ADHD that begins during childhood reduces the risk of developing substance use disorders as an adult. Pathological overactivation of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopamine pathway that connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, plays a central role in amphetamine addiction. Individuals who frequently self-administer high doses of amphetamine have a high risk of developing an amphetamine addiction, since chronic use at high doses gradually increase the level of accumbal ΔFosB, a \"molecular switch\" and \"master control protein\" for addiction. Once nucleus accumbens ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it begins to increase the severity of addictive behavior (i.e., compulsive drug-seeking) with further increases in its expression. While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction. Sustained aerobic exercise on a regular basis also appears to be an effective treatment for amphetamine addiction; exercise therapy improves clinical treatment outcomes and may be used as a combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy, which is currently the best clinical treatment available.\n\n\nPharmacological treatments\n\nFurther information: Addiction § Research\n\nAs of 2015, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for amphetamine addiction. Reviews from 2015 and 2016 indicated that TAAR1-selective agonists have significant therapeutic potential as a treatment for psychostimulant addictions; however, as of February 2016, the only compounds which are known to function as TAAR1-selective agonists are experimental drugs. Amphetamine addiction is largely mediated through increased activation of dopamine receptors and co-localized NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens; magnesium ions inhibit NMDA receptors by blocking the receptor calcium channel. One review suggested that, based upon animal testing, pathological (addiction-inducing) psychostimulant use significantly reduces the level of intracellular magnesium throughout the brain. Supplemental magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce amphetamine self-administration (i.e., doses given to oneself) in humans, but it is not an effective monotherapy for amphetamine addiction.\n\nBehavioral treatments\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addictions. Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions. In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density. One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or c-Fos immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.\n\nMore information: Form of neuroplasticity or behavioral plasticity, Type of reinforcer …\n\nDependence and withdrawal\n\nDrug tolerance develops rapidly in amphetamine abuse (i.e., recreational amphetamine use), so periods of extended abuse require increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect. According to a Cochrane review on withdrawal in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine, \"when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose.\" This review noted that withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in roughly 88% of cases, and persist for 3–4 weeks with a marked \"crash\" phase occurring during the first week. Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, depressed mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and lucid dreams. The review indicated that the severity of withdrawal symptoms is positively correlated with the age of the individual and the extent of their dependence. Mild withdrawal symptoms from the discontinuation of amphetamine treatment at therapeutic doses can be avoided by tapering the dose."}

{"body":"You normally produce serotonin while you sleep at night. A lot of times when you’re drunk, your body doesn’t go into REM sleep, so you’re not able to produce as much serotonin throughout the night. The next day, you’ll definitely feel more anxious as a result of this because your brain is lacking the chemicals it needs. Just try to get good sleep tonight and tomorrow, and you should feel back up to normal in a day or two!"}

Everyone has their own internal sense of how long a moment is.\n\nAs we age, a moment become a smaller and smaller fraction of the totality of time leading it to feeling like the days, weeks, and months pass by quicker. When you're younger, a year ago will feel longer than what a few years ago feels for someone older.\n\nSure, it feels subjectively different looking back on something 5-10 years ago when you're older than doing the same while younger, but the gap isn't ultimately that wide when you look at the percentages.\n\nNever too young to look back on fond memories. They give hope to make future ones."}

{"body":"On that note, I’ll never be doing acid again (sadly) because of the risk of it recurring. I’ll never do a dose beyond 2g of shrooms again either, not even sure when that time will come. Probably still won’t dabble with mdma for a while either in fear of anxiety kicking in hard. ( I have done both substances, shrooms 3 times with 2.5-4g, and mdma once a month for about a year. Those doses are all over map but never more than .5 in a night). And I don’t care for blow anymore after a bit of a binge that was a month before I decided to stop all substances about a year ago, due to the symptoms we discussed. Once it starts getting better, you actually feel like you have a grip on it and can read how you’re feeling about it.

If I ever met again I would post his name in glory and rate him 10 stars, im just retarded and cant remember his name atm. Anyway he offered me a ride around. Chatting about all types of shit while doing a route around the streets was so relaxing. Took me up a hill to a park. Had a ciggie and talked about the good ol movies, police academy, shawshank redemption and back to the  future, the great escape. When movies had soul and not any of this cgi bull shit we see everywhere today. Dropped me back off home. Had a mate to mate handshake and off he went.

But I also want to live a life with all my dreams coming true. \n\nI do not want to feel like I'm broken. So I decided that. Well. Cocaine has got to go. It serves no purpose. Maybe a bit of a boost socially then alcohol. But it's too dangerous in multiple ways. \n\nAlcohol however is the bread and butter of our society. I use to think I was hopeless and had no control over my booze. But once I realized that my goals in life are WAY more important to me than getting drunk. And getting stubborn about \" hey sorry man I dont want to go out drinking I have blah blah blah in the morning\" \n\nThis was when I was able to have a single drink at dinner with some old friends. And to be able to say \" hey I got to get up early.\" Instead of getting absolutely wasted cause why not. Because my future goals are more important than getting drunk. \n\nIf I told anyone where I want to be in 20 years they would die laughing. But I believe I can. And the work that's needed to achieve that has no time for getting drunk on weekends with close friends. And I dont think going into it with an attitude of \" I'm a broken alcoholic \" will make it any better either. \n\nBecome addicted to your ideal self. Realize alcohol dependance and escapism is all about living a false life. It's not alcohol that's the problem. It's you. Do everything you can to achieve your dream. Even if that means ending a relationship or moving to a new city."}

{"body":"From what i gather just from talking to people and experiencing these things, is that there is no getting around the fact that psychedelics pretty much change EVERYTHING in life. The whole experience itself changes, it goes from seeing the fame of chess as a black board with white spots, to a white board with blacl spots. Commonly this will change how some people react with certain substances. It doesn't have to be weed (although that's common) but for me sex is just an entirely different thing now. 100% different and i know its never going back. I'm ok with that because I'm willing to sacrifice the comfortable world im familiar with for an experience that can expose me to knowledge outside my current stature or even my perceptual limitations. \n\nI guess what im trying to say is there's no way of knowing if any of that will happen to you, usually it doesn't. But you have to be ok and willing tp give up and put everything you hold dear on the line with psychedelics. The fact is it doesn't matter how you Wil relate to weed after you trip,what's important is that you are a better person after the trip than you are right now. If giving up weed is part of what it takes for you to further your self in that way, that's what it takes and you should stand up straight with your shoulders back and move on. Things change, life changes, that death and family are the only things life guarantees.

Dramamine is usually taken to prevent or reduce nausea and motion sickness.\n\nDo bear in mind that long term abuse of diphenhydramine can cause brain damage, and even one trip will be most likely one of the worst experiences you've ever had.\n\nEdit: it is definitely not like acid, and you will likely not be aware that you are tripping, as it is a deliriant, not a psychedelic."}

{"body":"No problem. There are tons of other RC psychedelics that you can easily buy from Canada. Most are safe, some have unknown toxicity profiles. Also if you want more crypto tips here are some: \n\nHow to acquire crypto? Best way is to buy from coinbase. They might give you issues when setting up an account, but if they don’t then they’re easy to work with. If coinbase doesn’t work, look for a nearby bitcoin atm or local seller on localbitcoins be prepared to pay some gnarly fees if you go this route. \n\nWhat to do with newly bought crypto? Immediately send it to a wallet you own. Never leave crypto on the exchange, and NEVER send crypto from an exchange directly to the RC vendor. You will almost certainly be throwing your crypto into the virtual trash can if you do that. I like to use the exodus wallet cause it’s secure enough for my uses and easy to use. Exodus can store many different crypto currencies. \n\nAlso, make sure that if you buy bitcoin, you send it to the bitcoin wallet. If you buy lite coin, send to the lite coin wallet, etc. If you send bitcoin to the lite coin wallet, vice versa, or send any crypto to a wallet not meant to store it, that crypto will be gone forever. Nobody will be able to recover it, it’ll just be permanently destroyed. So don’t make that mistake. \n\nAlso, be aware that crypto transactions (especially withdrawing from an exchange) aren’t always instant. When you place an order, the RC vendor will randomly generate an address that you must deposit to. If you don’t make the deposit within the time they tell you, the order is cancelled. If you want to buy $50 worth of drugs, buy $80 worth of crypto first, then once it’s sitting in your wallet, place your RC order. You can then either hold that crypto or sell it right after."}

Did you know that the castle bravo (first ever fusion bomb on earth) detonation was only supposed to be 5-8 megatons if memory serves me well, but the scientists were completely wrong and it ended up with a detonation of 15 megatons. This caused all their testing equipment to be evicerated in the blast. Next time instead of calling someone stupid for not knowing one word, make sure they aren't well versed in anything else. You faced me in a field of literacy when my passion is the field of science and history. I doubt you know that the M1A2 Abrams main battle tank used by the US military uses depleted uranium in both its armor and Discarding Sabot rounds that can fire over 1km/s and can protect from any high explosive anti tank round unless they are hit where the CHAUBM (armor) is not located, such as sides, rear, and top. Or did you know that the element bismuth is the densest non radioactive atom (though it releases alpha radiation, this is at a half life of ~ twice the universe's current age, thus it is considered non radioactive), but due to it's crystal structure is not the densest when in the real world. But it's unique crystal structures it can form the most beautiful and colorful formations. \n\nPlease stop hating on conservatives.

No research matters to anyone like that.\n\nFor that matter, I have no educated opinion specifically on giving 2-year-olds amphetamines, but 2-years-old is around when kids first start to become self-aware and conscious, and IIRC the most critical development occurs between years 2 and 4.

{"body":"Legalize it all but with some regulations.  Must be 18 to buy weed \u0026amp; 21 to buy anything else.  All plant drugs can be freely grown by anyone \u0026amp; sold as long as you pay taxes on your sales \u0026amp; have a license to sell.  (And follow all laws, such as requiring ID).  \n\nHarder drugs like crack, PCP, heroin \u0026amp; the like would be sold only through specified controlled channels to users (most of whom are already addicts most likely).  Said facilities would include safe injection rooms, naloxone, informational literature \u0026amp; basic EMT/first aid stuff.  Since it's all legal \u0026amp; regulated, the problem of adulterated drugs \u0026amp; unknown doses goes out the window.  All drugs become pure \u0026amp; pharmaceutical grade.  \n\nRehab should be affordable/free as should meds like Suboxone, methadone, Antabuse, etc.  Anyone who wants to get sober should have every resource available.  Drug education in schools should incorporate honest harm reduction info immediately along with the scare tactics (because, let's face it, some drugs will fuck you up).  This too will reduce overdose/addiction rates because \"Just Say No\" without harm reduction doesn't work.  \n\nMy theory is that, if some of the less harmful drugs were legal \u0026amp; widely available, fewer people would WANT to use crap like Spice, fentanyl \u0026amp; other overly-potent crap.  In fact I'm pretty certain this is the case.  We still need drugged driving laws, child protection \u0026amp; other laws that punish people who endanger others in the course of drug use.   \n\nFree all non-violent drug offenders currently in prison while you're at it.  We need all the space we can get in there for rapists, murderers, child abusers, animal abusers \u0026amp; other violent psychopaths."}

What is the purpose of the geometry that so many people experience.\n\nThe last thing I want to say is that i believe there is more than meets the eye when it comes to what is behind the curtain in our own reality. Once you start saying that psychedelics allow you too peek into the true nature of our reality and that their exist these other aspects of our universe that we can’t see normally; you start to sound like a crazy person and rightfully so.

I usually just get kinda high, and I've noticed that when I occasionally get super stoned to the point where my headspace drastically changes and I feel like I'm in a fishtank vs when everything just seems a bit more dreamlike and interesting, I get super vivid dreams.\n\nI have this head theory that certain situations stimulate the unconscious mind, or a part of it. Specifically, transition periods like going on vacation or starting college - I got some really intense dreams last year, which was the first. Getting really fucking stoned takes you into unconscious territory and stirs the pot of your mind, so it can intensify dreams even if it shortens them.

{"body":"I’m familiar with how clinical depression works - I never implied that I had conquered my depression, only that this philosophy has helped me to combat it. Whether your depression originates from genetics or a life event, it does not exist in a vacuum. There are steps one can always take (both pharmaceutical and meditative) to help ward off its throes.\n\nIf you want to believe that clinical depression cannot be helped by any means other than medication, then that’s fine, but it’s simply not true. Even for someone suffering from an extreme mental affliction like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, there are always ways for us to change our outlook on life. These afflictions cannot always be cured through psychological means, but we can learn to cope with them healthily. This is why therapy exists, and what I’m suggesting is a method of inner-therapy.\n\nFor someone with clinical depression the illness will voice itself through unhealthy thought patterns - thoughts which are often rooted in anxiety or guilt. Anxiety is by definition based in the future. The dog suffers in the present, yes, but only because he is worried that his owner will not return in the future. If the dog could learn to accept the fact that the future does not matter then it would exist happily in the present, and only in the present.\n\nYou can suffer in the present moment, but that doesn’t mean you’re living in the present moment. To live in the moment is to exist without fear for the future or regret for the past. To accept that your worldly fears and desires are irrational and then bask in the temporary nature of everything."}

I don’t mind having a high tolerance with weed but that’s about it honestly. When I first started doing nitrous I would get those feelings but they would fade so quickly I couldn’t remember the revelations I was coming to lol. \n\nThe K hole you most certainly have time to remember what you are seeing. The last time I did it I felt like I was watching my consciousness from a TV and I was basically floating through these imaginary landscapes with the idea that I was reaching some ultimate conclusion, it was buggy cause it felt like my life was a bunch of Quick time events and I had to think and do the right things otherwise I wouldn’t be able to reach what destiny I guess lmao. I started panicking cause I was running out of time to do what I needed to do, which I can’t even remember. At this point I ran out of time and I felt like I just doomed my existence, I then got this thought in my mind that all the drugs I took had caused permanent insanity and that i was stuck in this dimension and I wouldn’t be able to escape. I was able to get myself out of it cause I’ve actually been in that same train of though in the past and after like 5 minutes I was able to completely relax. Granted I was on a ridiculous combination of LSD-weed-shrooms-mdma-ketamine-whippets, but all K-Holes have around that same amount of intensity regardless of the other drugs you told.\n\nWhippets are not guaranteed to give me that intense or an experienced but I will say that there is the opportunity to hit the golden whippet but it’s incredibly rare for me at least. The first time I got an incredible experience with whippets I was on shrooms and I took a whippet in VR. I was listening to hot stuff by Donna summer and the only way I could describe the experience is God’s roller coaster. I watched everything in my field of view curve inward and it felt like I was launched out of a cannon at the speed of light. I fucking felt G force and the most exhilaration of my entire life. All I could do was scream in joy because it was fucking amazing. All this reminds me that I have some pretty good trip reports that I need to right out"}
{"body":"Hey sorry I took so long, I had to drive home. \n\nI did have a pretty good routine. I was lucky enough to get hired at a ski resort 3 hours from all my friends and connects. I skied every day at lunch and most days off. I didn’t attend meetings during that time, so the separation was really key for me. I also used dabs to cope with cravings. Some people might have an issue with that, but I couldn’t handle them otherwise. \n\nI think doing something you enjoy is definitely key. Skiing is my favorite thing in the world so it definitely helped. \n\nHappiness didn’t come til way later though. Some people say like a year of recovery and you’ll start to feel happy."}

I wish that I could complain about too many strains.\nI really wish that I could buy edibles and know how much the dosage is. I wish that I can buy high quality BHO from companies that can show you the lab results of the product that they make.\nIf I all I had to complain about marijuana was the tackiness of the packaging I’d be way better off.

After about a month the panic attacks went away and now I've smoked daily for the last 2 years! Hardly an achievement but it feels like one.\n\n\nIf you want my advice, just take it easy with the smoking and understand that nobody knows what reality is, nobody ever will. No point worrying about it, we're all in the same fucked up boat. We're all gonna die one day so may as well enjoy whatever the fuck reality is rather than stress about it!"}

{"body":"I enjoyed that post. You’re pretty articulate and from my understanding you’re spot on with your knowledge of neurotransmitters relative to the drugs that affect their concentrations in the brain(Intriguing hypotheses asked by people with at least a basic understanding of neurochemistry are rarely found here). Also gotta agree with your correlation of each neurotransmitter with an associated  human emotion (e.g. serotonin and joy). Although that’s probably a bit simplistic(serotonin for example seems to modulate all sorts of different aspects of human behavior, not just joy/love/happiness), you’re definitely on the right track. I’d agree that amphetamines are the most enjoyable until they start to wear off so I’d say opioids are definitely the most rewarding (im a semi regular consumer of both). Probably the most fulfilling artificially induced emotional experience IMO is MDMA but only really the first few times before the magic wears off."}

Well, after my first lsd trip, he came home from school and we starting talking about life and had some deep conversations. At this point in our lives, we didnt talk much and needed to work on our relationship as we used to fight a lot when e were younger. After talking for a few hours and rekindling our relationship, I slipped out how I took LSD earlier that day hen he was at school and it made me find myself again and made me realize how important things in life, like our relationship are.\n\nHe was a little shocked for a second, but was then very intrigued and started googling LSD and wanted to try it himself."}

{"body":"Thanks for posting this I really needed to read it after what I'm considering doing. Haven't tweaked in 6 months... been really wanting to but can't find Adderall and my friend is suggesting me to buy Meth and do equal-to-adderall oral-only doses.  \n\n  \n\nI miss the long sessions of \"touching the PP \" LMAO. I wish I could just find Adderall and get enough for 3 sessions and call it quits again for another long while. I am so bothered by the Meth stigma that I do not want to even do it even if orally at the same dose it's the same as Adderall. I just don't, I KNOW I will be tempted into vaping that shit. I KNOW IT. Worrisome. Still some part of me is trying to convince myself that I can get by without vaping and only take the 30mg orally and save a bit more for oral, and flush the rest.  \n\n  \n\nThis is after having used Adderall maybe 5 times over 2 months, 6 months ago. Granted I've also used many other substances (never addicted to ONE yet, but probably the feeling of being high).  \n\n  \n\nI had about 11 30mg IR's back then, and used them over 5 different sessions over 2 months. Amphetamine is the only substance I crave in this way, despite having only used those few times so long ago. And I have tried a LOT of substances. Every category besides Opiates.  \n\n  \n\nI feel like I just need to get my rush and then I can quit again for a while, being satisfied. But deep down I know I probably shouldn't, because I know what this points to in the long run. But there is this part of me in the back of my mind trying to justify it, that it's just \"time\" again and then I will repeat the cycle, stop, go again some time down the road. And maybe I could get away with that, maybe. I have had great restraint in all my drugs besides MDMA (can't resist more if it's in front of me and I start coming down). I resisted redosing Adderall easily, I resisted Cocaine redoses even easier (granted I never did enough of it to enjoy it like others do), and I just dunno. Well, I know, but you know what I mean, lol.  \n\n  \n\nI want it... but I don't need it. I feel like I need it, but I know I don't. Complicated. I haven't even really thought about it much except the first month or two after that binge, and then now about 4-5 months later I'm fiending for it. Probably cause I recently am taking breaks from other drugs that are giving me cravings. I hope that's all anyway. Guess we'll see."}

My third time I I thought I took 25 g but actually took 81g :/ pretty fucking dumb but WOW it was intense. At first I felt an impending sense of doom for a few hours like I was going to have a heart attack around 6 o'clock I was just so disassociated it was uncomfortable. At night I listened to music which I will admit was the BEST enhancer of music. I felt the raw raw emotion of the singer and the instruments sounded clearer, I heard notes I never heard before probably because my brain was wired differently. It was euphoric and dysphoric I fell asleep but woke up in agonizing pain I ended up vomiting so hard I thought I was going to genuinely die because I thought all my organs would come out. I was rushed to the hospital where they immediately put me on a bed and put an iv into me. The nurse told me that was some really stupid shit I did. The nutmeg made me feel like I was in an almost coma like state because of how easily I slept by simply closing my eyes then I would wake up 5 hrs later which felt like mere seconds. I didn't have dreams and I would just fall back asleep just as easily and wake up again many hours later of what felt like a few seconds. The comedown was strangely relaxing but I would definitely never take that much ever again. I could have died and am lucky to be alive but low doses are okay as long as you don't do it frequently as nutmeg is a carcinogenic."}

I don’t know if you can help. \n\nThat’s an example of leading. You don’t ask for the drug. It’s their job to treat the symptoms usually with drugs and as long as you have your story thorough in your mind (more thorough than it needs to be) then you’ll do fine. \n\nOther tips, if you do end up asking for “something like Xanax” (play it cool, you don’t know which benzo is best etc) and the Doctor is hesitant, don’t push it. It shows you aren’t begging drugs and are leaving it up to them. If that happens they will prescribe it. \n\nMaybe switch doctors if it feels unnatural to do this with your current. \n\nHelps?"}

{"body":"The guy is a pedophile and tried to drug you so he could have sex with a minor. If the pills had worked he would have either hoped you wouldnt remember anything or if you did remember he would blame the drugs and say they made him do it. He would then manipulate you into keeping it a secret so he didn’t get in trouble. This is why when sober he refers to you as a friend and little sister so you don’t suspect his true intent. When he cuddled and kissed you he slipped and messed up and couldn’t control his urge to do so. \n\nI’ve heard these kinds of stories before you’re just one of the lucky ones that didn’t get raped because that’s what he would have done. My ex gf had this happen to her but she was 12 at the time and the guy was 19. And the same thing happened to my cousins gf we met them at our group therapy meetings. You need to stay away from this guy. He is a criminal and a degenerate person who only wants to have sex and not get caught. I would not be surprised if he tried again or realized you caught on and cut ties quickly. Please stay away and be safe\n\nEdit: Only take drugs with people you seriously know well and that you trust you’re life with and when you’re young and with a dude older than you do drugs in a group of people. \n\nEdit 2: I forgot to mention the drugs you were given. They are not used for intense euphoria they are codeine mixed with Tylenol. And 6 is a fucking shit ton of Tylenol to take at once. Codeine is understood as the least euphoric opiate. I have done codeine many times it’s not “intense euphoria”. However it is the most sedating out of all the opiates in high doses (which he gave you) more so than oxy and hydros  which are very very strong opiates only prescribed for intense pain. I can tell you as a person studying pharmacology and as a person who has helped rape victims that this was a deliberate use of the drug to sedate you and rape you. You need to let the police know about this guy. \n\nPlease trust me on this I know we are complete strangers and my words have no real meaning to you but I know what I’m talking about. At least text him and be completely away from him and tell him you understand what he did and that you are not okay with it and that if he contacts you again or try’s to see you that you will contact the police. I know some people can’t see it right away and don’t want to get the person they like in trouble. But if you go with calling and telling him to stay away and not contact the police he could get away with it with some other girl. It’s your choice I understand both of them"}

{"body":"Yes it does. When a cannabis plant grows seeds, it devotes ALL the energy it was sending to the buds and trichomes to growing the seeds, as they require tons of energy. Seeds are usually from a hermaphrodite since male plants are removed early on in flower as they are sexed. Hermie plants are female plants that are too stressed so they pollinate themselves and create seeds. When a female polliantes itself, it isnt sending energy to the buds (which it only does to get itself pollinated to begin with) but rather the seeds because reproduction is top dog in the biological kingdom.\n\nIf you see seeds in your bud, at least SOME of the potency and smell is lost because that's just how biologically cannabis works."}

{"body":"Nitrous was the first of the more intense psychoactive drugs I ever did and I grew to love and hate it. I stopped doing balloons after a while because I’d overdo it and then feel somewhat brain dead but at the dentist I always ask for the gas. After about 15 minutes of constant breathing, I get into this zone where I’m in a constant déjà vu which loops into my other nitrous experiences and I can predict every word of conversation between my dentist and her assistant which is always bizarre. (Obviously I’m not really predicting it in advance) but for some reason it feels like I know exactly what they say before they say it. Then after 20 minutes I’m reduced to nothing and I just remember feeling like this feeling was the only real thing that I actually am. It’s so hard to explain but this feeling is like being merely existent but nothing more than that and that feels more real than anything else which is almost impossible to explain. While it has a wrap as some drug that turns you brain dead and empty headed for 30 seconds it has some real potential for self discovery and in that one moment, destroys your ego and boundaries we develop and just reduced me to a simple existence. Quite intense experience for dentist gas but it was on a high level. Bizarre"}

It was developed as a precursor in an alternate synthesis line to a haemostatic in an attempt to circumvent a patented synthesis. Tested on rodents briefly but really just left to sit until decades after we seized the merck records at the end of WWII when Shulgin began experimenting with it. Perhaps you're thinking of his earlier work for Dow when he developed insecticides? Either way apparently the diet pill thing is just a myth that has become so popular it's found in many academic papers and textbooks. The MDMA Wikipedia page has a link to a paper by some guys who searched through all the old merck files to trace it's development. The PDF link is 24 in the citation footnotes."}

{"body":"It's true that psychotropic drugs aren't always the answer, but medical professionals aren't always the answer either. Most professionals have little experience with psychotropic drugs and can't understand the nuances that recreational users appreciate, I have personally seen this as a med student. \n\nAdditionally there's no financial motive for anyone to push a drug through clinical trials unless it can be patented. LSD has shown promise for depression, but who is going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to prove that for a drug that is practically free? \n\nLSD does not need to be taken chronically so there's no way to build up to the side effects that SSRIs have, and there's no withdrawal symptoms either. But there is a well documented change in mindset associated with tripping once. \n\nSo if your friend is depressed, maybe there's nothing wrong with saying they could try LSD once and see if it makes a difference."}

High protein. \n\n3. Inquiries where he was with no contact. \n\n4.Finally just have him submit to a track mark look over and if he agrees obviously a drug test at random but be careful as this could backfire and frustrate him. \nThe feeling of violation will be there. \n\nTHE BANK ACCOUNT IDEA WORKS GREAT AND RECEIPTS FOR CASH."}
{"body":"It's actually still in debate whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic. As trials continue, they are finding that its actually a lot safer than assumed.

{"body":"Yes it is. Drugs are very often in hydrochloride solutions, even if it isn't sold as such. It's completely safe and is done because it makes amine groups water soluble, so they can be absorbed better by the body.

{"body":"\u0026gt; I think it’s hard to overstate the cognitive significance of major psychedelics for the future of sentience. But it’s also hard to convey why these agents can be valuable tools of investigation to academics who have never tried them. I know distinguished drug-naive philosophers of mind (and transhumanists) who are certain that psychedelia can’t be significant – and it would be irresponsible to urge them to put their assumptions to the test. Perhaps the best I can do is offer an analogy. Imagine an ultra-intelligent tribe of congenitally blind extraterrestrials. Their ignorance of vision and visual concepts is not explicitly represented in their conceptual scheme. To members of this hypothetical species, visual experiences wouldn’t be information-bearing any more than a chaotic drug-induced eruption of bat-like echolocatory experiences would be information-bearing to us. Such modes of experience have never been recruited to play a sensory or signaling function. At any rate, some time during the history of this imaginary species, one of the tribe discovers a drug that alters his neurochemistry. The drug doesn’t just distort his normal senses and sense of self. It triggers what we would call visual experiences: vivid, chaotic in texture and weirder than anything the drug-taker had ever imagined. What can the drug-intoxicated subject do to communicate his disturbing new categories of experiences to his tribe’s scientific elite? If he simply says that the experiences are “ineffable”, then the sceptics will scorn such mysticism and obscurantism. If he speaks metaphorically, and expresses himself using words from the conceptual scheme grounded in the dominant sensory modality of his species, then he’ll probably babble delirious nonsense. Perhaps he’ll start talking about messages from the gods or whatever. Critically, the drug user lacks the necessary primitive terms to communicate his experiences, let alone a theoretical understanding of what’s happening. Perhaps he can attempt to construct a rudimentary private language. Yet its terms lack public “criteria of use”, so his tribe’s quasi-Wittgensteinian philosophers will invoke the (Anti-)Private Language Argument to explain why it’s meaningless. Understandably, the knowledge elite are unimpressed by the drug-disturbed user’s claims of making a profound discovery. They can exhaustively model the behaviour of the stuff of the physical world with the equations of their scientific theories, and their formal models of mind are computationally adequate. The drug taker sounds psychotic. Yet from our perspective, we can say the alien psychonaut has indeed stumbled on a profound discovery, even though he has scarcely glimpsed its implications: the raw materials of what we would call the visual world in all its glory.\n\n \n\n\u0026gt; Anyhow, I worry that our own predicament resembles in more extreme form the hubris of the blind super-rationalists I describe above. In fact, intellectually, I worry far more about my ignorance of other modes of conscious existence than I do my cognitive biases or deficiencies of reasoning within ordinary waking consciousness. Sure, I’d love to know the master equation of a unified field theory. I’d love even more to know what it’s like to inhabit a world of echolocation like a bat – and to understand the indescribable weirdness of LSD, DMT or Salvia. It transpires that ordinary waking and dreaming consciousness are just two among numerous wholly or partially incommensurable realms of sentience. What we call waking consciousness was doubtless a fitness-enhancing adaptation in the ancestral environment of adaptation. But it occupies only a tiny fraction of experiential state-space. Our ignorance is all the more insidious because it is not explicitly represented in our conceptual scheme. From the inside, a dreamer has little insight into the nature of a dream, even in rare moments of “lucid dreaming”; and I fear this may be true of ordinary waking consciousness too. Unfortunately, the only way to even partially apprehend the nature of radically altered states is by first-person investigation, i.e. to instantiate the neurochemical substrates of the states in question. If drug-naive, you can’t fruitfully read about them. Compare how (ostensibly) trivial is the difference in the gene expression signature of neurons mediating phenomenal colour and sound. Who knows what further categories of experience other “trivial” bimolecular variations will open up, not to speak of more radical neurochemical changes? Thousands of scholarly philosophy papers and books have been written on consciousness in recent years by drug-naive academics. Psychedelic researchers worry that too many of them evoke Aristotelean scholasticism, whereas what we need is a post-Galilean experimental science of consciousness. Perhaps the nearest I come to an intellectual hero is psychedelic chemist Alexander Shulgin, whose pioneering methodology is described in PiHKAL. Alas, Shulgin doesn’t yet occupy a prominent place in the transhumanist pantheon.\n\n \n\n\u0026gt; It’s worth stressing that taking psychedelics is not a fast-track passport to either happiness or wisdom. If you take the kappa opioid agonist Salvinorin A found in Salvia divinorum, for instance, you might easily have a waking nightmare. And the experience may easily be unintelligible rather than illuminating. Even in a society of sighted people and a rich visually-based conceptual scheme, it takes years for a congenitally blind person who is surgically granted the gift of sight to master visual literacy. So understanding the implications of radically altered states may well take millennia. I’d hazard a guess and say comprehension will take millions of years and more. Either way, our descendants may be not just superintelligent but supersentient – blessed with the capacity to shift between a multitude of radically different modes of consciousness whose only common ingredient is the molecular signature of bliss. Posthuman mastery of reward circuitry will let them safely explore psychedelia in a way most humans beings don’t dare. Yes, it’s prudent for us to play safe; but in consequence our consciousness may be comparatively shallow and one-dimensional. Mine is today.\n\n \n– David Pearce‘s response to a question during an H+ interview (Autumn 2009)"}

Very unfortunate, I did Psylocybe Cubensis probably 4 times and LSD once.

Every life lost, whether to illicit drugs or because a patient couldn't tolerate their physical pain has made this world a little dimmer because every life is sacred and precious. Also, There are diseases like Arachnoiditis and Complex Regional Syndrome that require opioids because people can't tolerate the pain. These patients are treated like guinea pigs and forced to go through every other treatment modality before they can even touch opioids.

You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports\n\nAs a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try.

It take 3 to 5 days to pass a piss tess, its possible for people to notice a change in mood coming off it yes. To be normal again? Well there is no set time frame but it's likely a few months but things get progressively better as time goes on, like i said the mental hook that meth has on many is the toughest factor to get over, the physical symptoms will pass much sooner.

Like it’s weird I feel like seroquel has actually MADE ME psychotic and I dont even have bipolar or schizophrenia just MDD and GAD but last night I literally felt high for no reason and it freaked me out because I had been completely sober that day literally had taken nothing not even supplements because my therapist wants me to stop taking everything except my adderall seroquel and she’s fine with weed but wants me to stop taking all the nootropics so I can see how it affects me. But like I all of a sudden felt this sense of impending doom but my brain was believing it so it was a different kind of panic attack it was more psychotic and I started hitting pillows and crying and screaming hysterically and it scared me and my parents Because I’ve never felt like that before quite it freaked me out like I physically felt crossfaded and that scared me since I was supposed to feel sober\n\nI was on Buspar for a few days the first week and it made me extremely nauseous and dizzy so I quit that \n\nI might move out of the dorm I feel bad about it but my parents and doctors think it’s best so they’re trying to get a medical thing to get me out and id just commute but I feel bad I mean my roommates are supportive and stuff and I think they think I’m crazy and like really fucked up which is partially true but idk?? \n\nI got a reduced coarseload too.

It's difficult to find evidence against what is actually an untested hypothesis because once you have a hypothesis you would test it, but the problem is that nobody has ever proposed a physiological mechanism for it so it's not a hypothesis worth testing and that's where we are now. All I have for you is that benzos are used clinically in stimulant overdose.\n\n\u0026gt; Agitation or persisting seizures in patients with amphetamine toxicity requires generous titration of benzodiazepines and a calm soothing environment. Avoid physical restraints, if possible.\n\nhttps://emedicine.medscape.com/article/812518-treatment#d10\n\nI don't see how it would strain the musculature of the heart. Benzos don't work directly on the heart, instead they reduce adrenaline release centrally. If you have read scientific or educational material that has led you to believe it then it would probably be better if you said why you understand it to be like that.

{"body":" I went thru many \"relationships\" with chicks like this...Had all but given up on them and was ill and bitter all the time, as well as drugged up. Without even attempting or thinking about it the best lady came into my life and finally after years of failed relationships and ups and downs I experienced what a real caring, loving person was like. 8 years later she's still here and just as amazing. Don't let yourself get down brother and don't rush into anything.  Trust me when your feeling down and have no hope the right one can show up anytime and it seems to be when you don't expect it at all. Keep your head up and be safe bud."}

For example I love my mother with all my soul and being but not in the same way as this girl. My love for my mother goes beyond a slight high i get. It's a feeling that would make me jump in front a bullet for her, because my mother and I share something that can't be achieved in a week."}
{"body":"Never hide benzos while you’re on benzos!!"}
{"body":"I saw the same lecture and it inspired me to try this method. A lot of people have gotten to a point where they think marijuana is weak or casual or both. Or say “i can’t get as high as I used to”\n\nI haven’t lost the “magic” in my maybe 3 years of frequent use but it is hard to use less than twice a week sometimes. Still. I usually only need one good bowl (still around 0.1 grams) to get some visuals, but maybe I’m still not going deep enough."}
{"body":"You're severely underestimating how expensive it can be to maintain an alcohol addiction. A litre of cheap vodka is £20+ and an alcoholic can go through that in a day or two. \n\nCost is definitely a factor, but capture rates account for it to an extent because anyone included in those stats can at least afford to use coke."}

{"body":"Alcohol has carcinogenic metabolites. The risk of cancer is inherent to the act of drinking it, and has been proven to cause cancer. A glass of wine a week won't save you, but it will put you less at risk than someone drinking a 12 pack every night. Doesn't mean there isn't any risk though. \n\nAnd yes, everything increases your risk of cancer. That's why, surprise surprise, cancer has been on the rise for the last 100 years. Pollution and increased sugar consumption are two of the main culprits.\n\nYou can be 'not fond' of the 'argument' (facts) but it doesn't make them any less real. I'm not saying you shouldn't drink. Do whatever the fuck you want. But understand that any amount of alcohol is a risk, and regular consumption is only going to increase that risk again and again. Moderation does not save you. A glass of wine a week can absolutely give you cancer."}

{"body":"It might not be as bad as you think it will. My parents were quite strict but thankfully they took it way more lightly than I imagined when they found out I had smoked weed. My father showed me a few heavy metal video clips saying that the videoclips describe the hell drug addicts go through. They also kept telling me that I'd get addicted to heroin etc. But that was it. They also got more relaxed about cigarettes because they said at least they're not weed."}

{"body":"MDMA and benzos/barbiturates both help/cure anxiety, but I feel like they do it differently. Obviously they work on different receptors, but what I mean is that benzos feel like they take away anxiety and leave you with a baseline feeling, which sometimes feels a bit empty, whereas MDMA leaves the anxiety there and transforms that excess nervous energy into an exciting, euphoric energy, which can be conflated with 'curing' or removing the anxiety. They work together great if you don't overdo the benzos."}
{"body":"in 50 years we will have either figured out a way to cure it or will be dead from nuclear war/climate change.\n\nAlso, im not advocating you eat half a gram of mdma (actually nah, fuck that, eating half a gram of md is fucking fun) regularly.

{"body":"You can get empty gelatin caps on amazon for like $2/100 or summin like that so you don’t burn your throat. Also, try to wait at least 2 months between rolls. MDMA is neurotoxic and your brain needs a MINIMUM of 4 weeks to recover if you don’t want lasting damage."}

{"body":"Love is very broad and can be used in different ways. For example I love each and every human being in a way that doesn't go any farther than simply caring for other human beings because I share that bond with them, even if I don't know them.

{"body":"Microdosing once or twice a week, for me personally at least, seems to have a much \"Lighter\" effect on my mind. Meaning I can still read, write, be active, and engaged with people while I'm microdosing or even low dosing (low dosing at most half a hit of LSD or around 3/4 g psilocybin or less).\n\nBut when I trip, I disengage from reality for a while. My energy is drained and I need rest after. It is difficult to interact and truly engage and be present with other people while I'm tripping. Tripping once a week seems like it would be quite taxing on my psyche. Comparatively, microdosing feels much lighter on the mind.\n\nDoes this help? Happy to answer more questions."}

{"body":"Honestly, I am not a super experienced drug use myself, but I think one bit of advice that has helped me with safely stretching boundaries is important no matter what you do.\n\nTaking a drug does not mean you will be happy. People often get addicted because they associate drugs with ‘de-stressing’ and partying, so they think that the drug makes them in that state (partly true). Then, that mentality leads to ‘i cannot be happy WITHOUT X drug,’ or ‘I need it.’ And by that point, you so desperately crave ‘happiness’ that you will irrationally justify your way around the negative effects, your life falling apart, etc. All to just be happy and escape life.\n\nBut if you go in knowing that whatever you are taking is just a drug, that drugs don’t manufacture happiness, and that real happiness lies within addressing the issues in your life instead of avoiding them, you are less prone to being addicted. In fact, escaping using drugs can possibly damage your chances and make you less able to achieve a better state with your life. \n\nThat being said, trying shit isn’t gonna ruin your life. Some people can even get away with doing certain things somewhat regularly and be fine. I don’t believe in legal restrictions, or the “just don’t do it” approach. Being high is a wonderful experience that everyone should have at least once WITH MODERATION. \n\nThat being said, I don’t believe in complete legalization of things like heroin or cocaine or PCP or meth or whatever. Some substances are just not meant to be put into our bodies. Period. \n\nBut if we had a broader range of education about safe and legal drugs, and we established a legal culture around it so that people don’t feel alienated and can understand properly what to do and how to do it, maybe we wouldn’t even have heroin cases. There would be no need for the underground drug market, and that sector of crime and abuse that is the high price to pay for the high you get would virtually disappear. Or at least diminish.\n\nI don’t mean to belittle people who do heroin or strong drugs, they are just unfortunate to have been caught up in them. Circumstance plays a large role in drug addiction, and I personally am a fucking rich white insulated male.

If you have severe enough depression, crippling pain, agoraphobia ect. there might not be.\n\n\u0026gt;Oh no, I fully agree, couldn't have said it better. But just like you said, in moderation and it is important why you do it. As a distraction for a short time to calm down etc. or to fully repress reality.\n\nI never suggested anyone should replace reality with weed, but if that's what's keeping you from suicide then by all means you should absolutely do it. If nothing else, it will buy you time for things to change.\n\n\u0026gt;I already mentioned that in my previous comment.\n\nThen stop talking as if there are cures for depression. There really aren't.\n\n\u0026gt;That is kinda gatekeeping don't you think?\n\nYou completely missed the point. I'm not trying to minimize anyone's depression. There is a difference between curing your depression and functional recovery. Even people who functionally recover will have bouts of depression throughout their life, because usually there's an underlying cause for depression, like severe trauma or an inability to stabilize the serotonin system. Even people who get their depression under control from medication will probably have to take that medication for life. If they stop, they go right back to being depressed, plus withdrawal symptoms."}

I would feel suspicious at some time and she ALWAYS had some excuse and in the back of my mind I knew it didn't add up and something was going on. This one might be the worst though. Probably 2-3 months ago. I work 3rd shift and I came home to her clothes and underwear in the living room and also a bottle of lube that we would use once in a blue moon. This was about 8am and she's still sleeping but she's completely naked and hungover. Her excuse was \"she wanted to surprise me in the morning but got too drunk\" so I ask why is there lube sitting by your pile of clothes and she says \" I forgot it was there and I fell asleep\" true fucking story. Pretty much since then I've been trying to catch her in the act. And we live together so it's gonna be hard to get her out of here."}

Confused or reminiscent thoughts. You start to think more. Change of short term memory leads to continual distractive thought patterns. Your brain starts to speed up and you become more aware of everything.\n\n110 mics- A hit of some really good lsd. Visuals are getting a lot more obvious now. \"Ripples\" over laying your field of vision. Patterns from all different cultures seen on walls, surfaces, faces etc. Closed eye hallucinations become more apparent.\"\n\nThis is not a spiritual journey for me, nor anyone I have ever met, as previously stated. Below is what i usually aim for when doing LSD. \n\n\"XXX mics- This is where things can get powerful. Your mind is racing. Beautiful colors are everywhere. Closed eye visuals are very apparent at this point. Life changing, spiritual experiences or realization can happen at this dose. If you are a noob to lsd this dose is simply too high for you. Many people can handle it quite well but some may freak out. \"\n\n \"XXX mics- your getting into heavy territory. Still not considered by most to be a heavy dose, but thats only because they know where most people including themselves draw the line if they are experienced.

{"body":"Personally, I stopped using substances because I FELT like they had a negative permanent affect on my brain. That’s said, I have ABSOLUTELY NO scientific data to back that, it’s merely a personal opinion.  In addition, I felt like I was doing myself a moral injustice by giving into the temptation, as in “why do I need these in my life? Am I empty enough inside to need to be on drugs?” Obviously that’s not a universal feeling, I acknowledge the copious amounts of reasons to get high, it just simply wasn’t for me. \n\nI believe everyone has to evaluate whether or not substances are “worth it” and “ok” for themselves, as I’ve found that it’s usually a question of morals and beliefs. \n\nI may be downvoted for this, and I really don’t mean any offense by this, but I believe substance use is usually never worth it, especially in younger years when going off to college. When you reach your later years where you don’t necessarily need that “brain power” anymore, by all means use away. That ties back to my NOT SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED OPINION” of them having a negative physical affect though. \n\nSo I suppose my take away here is that it’s up to you.

{"body":"Your risk mitigation is so short sighted its hilarious. When you sell to end users you are completing that products journey. The user is going to take it home and use it. All loose ends are wrapped up in a week as the drug is consumed and no longer poses a liability. When you sell to a dealer you sell larger quantities that sit around on the person. The more dealers you sell too the more people that have your product lying around waiting to be found by the police. Dealers are also way more likely to need to cop a plea deal than an end user that is looking at a fine. \n\nBut you also keep pushing a drug that is a federal offense vs one that is largely decriminalized. For being a lsd distributor you are looking at the rest of your life in federal fuck you in the ass prison. If you are flipping enough to be a regular distributor you probably have enough product to spend two lifetimes in jail. The police dog doesn't have to find them. Your dealer will try to sell some get caught with the sheet and start telling them everything about you. \n\nAlso you say you buy them for 150 and flip them for 450 (3x the amount). Ive never dropped more than 6 or 7 bucks a hit. So your dealers are making like 1.50 to 2.50 a hit for federal fucking charges. Math checks out boys this guys a genius."}

{"body":"What do you want add about RC's?\n\nYeah, we typically have no idea about their long term effects, but at least some of them can more than likely be used safely. Especially the ones that are pro-drugs for known substances, such as 1P-LSD (which metabolizes into LSD-25), and 4ACO-DMT (same for psilocin).\n\nOn the positive side, at least you know that you get what you ordered with RC's. Illegal drugs are often contaminated, or something else entirely. Of course tests kits can pick out most of those cases, but with RC's you're virtually certain. Also, there's no criminality involved, and no chemical waste being dumped into nature.\n\nEven with RC's there are some important harm reduction measures that can be taken, like starting with a sub threshold dose to test for allergic reactions, slowly working your way up, etc. . \n\nSo I think it's reasonable to approach questions regarding RC's in the same way as any other drug: give accurate information, and tell them you don't think it's a good idea (and why) if that's how you feel.\n\nP.S. I've never used any RC, I'm nowhere near done exploring  legal non-RC substances (of which there are quite a few where I live)."}

So i started experimenting with different substanced like alcohol and acid mostly just to feel somthing then i stopped completely smoking and i dont really feel much happier, i just constantly feel groggy and depressed, even though im not depressed or sad in any way i just cant help but feel life pass me by as i see all my friends do cool things together without me. As of now im doing good i havent smoked in a few months witch is a long time for me but i still feel the depressed effects of not smoking and put me into bad habits with alcohol and im not 21 yet so the only way to get it is to steal it which i have been doing successfully for months now. I dont really know why im saying all this except to maybe get somone that knows how this is."}

{"body":"Last year I started the school year off with a one month t break- I was trying to be clean by early October. I threw myself into my studies and did great in all my classes, and once I stopped having weed and the cravings went away (within the first week) I didn't feel a need to smoke even with my roomie burning every day. At the end of the month, I still wasn't clean. I took a home test, there were no negative repercussions. Granted I'm not very active and I didn't make any other changes to get clean (no exercising up until the day before, didn't try diluting it or using creatine or anything). When I finally smoked again it had all the magic of my first time smoking. It was amazing. My tolerance built up more quickly than when I first started smoking (not surprising to me). All in all it was definitely worth it, 10/10 would recommend. Honestly I'm looking forward to doing it again this year. Starts in a little more than a week, wish me luck!"}

{"body":"Yup. And so far just a day slept the other couple days feeling tired but now I'm not so tired. I'm scared. I'm scared with a mission that's real. Real to me, but maybe I can show some proof if it's possible. Basically in a dimension between both Light (ours) and Sound (opposite) due to them finally meeting at a midpoint and me being able to somehow tap into it, at first only visually, and now ability-wise (control of pressure/air, vibration control, light control, touch control being able to touch objects from far away etc.). So I can say things sound very very psychotic but it's as true as I can make it out to be.\nI'll sound crazy right off the bat, but I think that's one of the reasons as to \"why\". Dopamine, Serotonin, etc. allow you to sorta tap into these other forces around you (and since I have synesthesia to a degree I was able to see the colored vibrations of sound/light which in response to music is actually one of the reasons why you can \"see\" colored lines/blobs etc. if you have synesthesia). The most common being hearing voices (sound dimension and all and here where I am I currently don't hear any whatsoever) especially if they are telling you to do something. I actually had one, a woman, urging me not to continue using Meth because I'm going to die that very day which was when I had that seizure and I guess I died (assuming a part of me that was important?) or truly me and another \"me\" had to take my place. I'm guessing the one that was supposed to be in control of Time keeping the two dimensions apart but on steady course. So things haven't been the best since then."}

I tried to space it out in a \"responsible\" way, so it would be metabolized before I slept.\n\nI've had more than that before, in deliberate suicide attempts and just when I fuck up, and didn't die."}
{"body":"There is a risk that it will be very uncomfortable for a while.\n\nThere's also probably the long term risk if you make it a habit, like rectal cancer (based on it causing oral cancers).\n\nBut if you think it's a good idea, have your friend go first."}
{"body":"Script opioids, being the controversy they already are, has so many sides to what can be done. I dont think any one person will be able to stop people from getting their hands dirty with this drug, let alone any drug. Whatever laws or regulations they put in place, there will be a way to get it if someone really wants it. We cannot eradicate this problem, but we can reduce it by putting less strains on those who are deemed abusers. Most people (old way of thinking) like to take destructive approaches like criminalizing these people. That doesnt exactly help the problem imo. We need to have more of a constructive approach. That is providing education and peer-to-peer talk therapy strategies for example. If someone has been given all this opportunity and they still can't find their way out, the least we can do is make sure they arent going to harm themselves or others. That is why harm reduction is important in this day and age, because we can prevent a death so maybe one day that person does come clean, and become a productive member of society. Humans deserve a chance."}

I dont think anyone can tell you 100% if you feel ready then go for it. Apart from the usual set and setting, I find just keeping a diazepam on me can help, knowing it can ease and dull the trip out if need be. Also smoking weed on acid can lead to a much more uncomfortable trip so try not to do it, I've had some really unpleasant moments after smoking so I no longer do. Good luck!"}

{"body":"Its not that your baseline for anxiety is higher it’s more that the rebound anxiety you’ll get will be way fucking worse for a little while. Benzos aren’t like Opiates. Opiate abuse makes you much more sensitive to pain when you quit. But honestly slow the fuck down if you don’t feel much on 2-4mg of Xanax you’re running into dangerous territory when you quit. Benzos are some of the only drugs that can kill you as a result of withdrawals. I would highly suggest talking to a doctor about tapering off. I couldn’t tell from your post if you’ve only used Xanax a few times and the does wasn’t high enough or if you are taking them as a script or daily from off the streets. If you are taking them without a script or for not reducing your anxiety you’re not going to feel anything off of them Xanax is not euphoric rappers and trashy people who promote the drug because it makes them cool are fucking dumb. Unless you are genuinely anxious you won’t feel good you’ll just feel slow and stupid people who use Xanax get really mad when you say shit like that but it’s true. Another reason is you don’t realize you’re high Xanax can give that effect you are high you just don’t realize you’re high."}
{"body":"Now that you've experienced some of your potential focus on training your mind and body to actualize that potential. Preferably before the stims push you farther away from that potentiality.

I basically just grew into some mild to moderate depression and anxiety with some mild panic attacks.  Not sure if this is xanax withdrawals but I’m considering it a possibility.  I might want to test this out if it is by seeing if taking it will ease my symptoms (after I sober from it) but I’m worried imma have to restart."}

But if you just wait an hour or so from last dose to eating and/or smoke a joint just before getting food I can normally stomach it. But I’m one of those weird types that can devour food when on it.

My tolerance isn't crazy high but it hits like a bong if you use it right, just throw the concentrates pad on top of a small amount of bud and it will vape the even .1 just fine with satisfying hits, but you can shove up to a gram in there and have a really heavy sesh where you tap out and forget the whole experience lol Happened many many times. \n\nMain tip: Grind fine, pack loose, draw lightly and slowly and you'll get fine rips. It also only draws terps until the weed heats up enough, so don't worry if the first 2 is just taste the heavy vapor is right after that.\n\nBonus tip: Vaped weed has nothing wrong with holding it in your lungs and breathing it in and out slightly until it's totally ghosted and settled in your lungs, it gets you way higher and ensures you waste no bud!

I don’t just talk to hear my voice like a lot of people do. They’ve also opened me up to my spiritual beliefs. I now cleanse my chakras, meditate, and astral project very frequently. Psychs have helped me find my consciousness that was buried deep inside me and I don’t think I would of found it if I was never introduced to them.

Don’t be afraid to call and carry your own narcan if you hang around a lot of opioid users (it’s just a spray in the nose and super easy to use)\n\nOh also.

{"body":"There's already a bunch of people telling you you're wrong, but I just want to share a personal experience. Once, a friend did actually want to test if indicas and sativas make a difference therefore he rolled two joints, one with pure indica and the other with an 80/20 sativa. He didn't tell me which is which, and simply told me to smoke either one. The first one I hit happened to be indica, and we just sat on a bench looking at a lake for around an hour and a half. Then, we smoked the sativa joint and spent the rest of the night dashing through the empty streets of our town on our longboards.\n\nNot saying this is irrefutable, concrete evidence of the difference between indica and sativa, it's just a personal experience which inclines me to believe that there is a difference between the two plant types."}
{"body":"Hell yes it is an incredible experience and there is no good way to explain it so the best course of action is to try it yourself.

If you really cant stand it, benzodizipines are maybe the best way to go, as they firstly can \"turn off\" your conciousness completely (be sure to not overdose too much) and they usually induce some kind of loss of memory.\n\nBUT I believe there are better ways. Accept your state, Adapt to it. enjoy it. Here are some things that I found to be helping:\n\n* Keep track of set and setting before you start.\n* It won't stay like this, even if it feels like that.\n* Try to keep yourself busy. Really doesnt matter what, most of the time, I get into whatever I'm doing so much, there's no room for any negativity. (I once watched my cig burn away because the smpke patterns were so beautiful. Proceedes to do so with the whole pack).\n*Music! Really important for me. Try psytrance. Thats what I like. But anythings better than silence.\n* Try dancing. Do not care how you might look, as long as it feels good, it IS good. (This applies to anything I do an a trip)\n* Switch location. If you are inside, go outside. Or just go to your bedroom for some time. New impeessions generally keep my head busy.\n\nBut everyone reacts different. Acid is mighty, really mighty.\nHave fun!"}

{"body":"I have not done a large (100mg+) IM dose but apparenty that is the way to go... having said that I have put 150mg+ up my nose, and as an experienced drug user, I found it boring. Yea I tripped a bit but but it was a small and uninteresting space.\n\nBeing on Ibiza at the time helped though. I had a dozen almost-pure substances to mix and match. Hit another unknown quantity of K with a large but also unknown quantity of cocaine, hashish, alcohol, and a mild opiate, all about 3 hours after a 200mg Mandy roll. I may also have topped up the Mandy...\n\n... soon afterwards I saw a golden god. I will not go into this as it was just for me, but it was profound, and very powerful. I also felt extreme euphoria and a massive headspace. It was the most hard hitting sledgehammer of a trip I've ever had despite having many visual experiences and crazy adventures etc.\n\nI should make clear I am a large person with silly tolerances and this combination would probably kill a normal person."}

And sometimes it's not a matter of needing to trip something out as much as it is just not the right time/place. \n\nIn general, people should not be afraid to trip. Because there's that exact amount of putting up with yourself that isn't just required for a good trip, but for life too.\n\nBut if people prefer just using them for fun rather than growth, I certainly understand the \"I need a good headspace\" as long as that's not just a permanent excuse to never work on yourself."}
{"body":"Hm. Well that’s entirely up to you. It could really help you. Even if it’s a bad trip. Those are the ones that have the most impact on you. But all the drugs do is teach you. You have to be able to integrate those lessons into your life. You know? I’m not one who really believes psychedelics are a “cure all” but for instance it’s been proven that psilocin (active chem in shrooms) aid in neurogenesis (birth of new neurons)  and are an effective treatment for depression. But it’s a big risk mind you. If you’ve never tripped or never had a bad trip. It’s hard to understand what a bad trip is like. It’s awful. Seriously fucking terrible I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemies.  But as I said, more Is  learned from the bad trips than the good ones. Though I’d prefer, as well I’m sure you do to, that you have a good trip. But take it all into consideration. Psychedelics aren’t for everyone. Especially if you’re in a bad mental place. It can take you places you don’t wanna go."}

My go to drinks were Beer or Whiskey maybe Rum or Vodka depending on the night) Psychedelics (LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, I've tripped on both more times than I can remember) Benzos (Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, I use to be addicted to Xanax), Opiates (Codeine syrup, I wasn't much of an opiate guy) Stimulants (Cocaine, MDMA, MDA, Vyvanse, I also use to be addicted to Cocaine and Vyvanse) Dissociatives (DXM)\nI use to combine lots of these as well like Mdma and mushrooms, Cocaine and alcohol (smoked it once while drinking), Benzos and alcohol, I smoke just about every time I drink too unless I'm at the bar and if I am I smoke before.

{"body":"Amphetamine only last 4-6 hours. Did you expect it to take longer? And to boost it you could plug it but since it’s street amph. I would advise against this because obviously it’s cut with something. It’s hard to increase duration without decreasing the high a bit and it’s hard to increase the high with sacrificing the duration. I would advise against snorting because its bioavailability is less then if you just swallowed it. If you want a longer high eat a lot of food before you take it and that will slow absorption but sacrifice intensity. If you want a stronger high. Don’t eat for 6-8 hours take 1500mg of tums and wait 30-60 minutes after taking the tums and then orally take amphetamine. You could also take something that is broken down by the cyp2d6 enzyme which will slow amphetamines break down and increase its concentration in your plasma."}

{"body":"So here's a question to mull over: if you're not addicted, and you're leaving days in between use and thus maintaining a low tolerance, why are you using the IV route?\n\nArguably if you're using to self-medicate, smoking or insufflation are actually going to be better because they will last longer, and you can titrate yourself to where you need to be (much harder to titrate with IV unless you're planning on loading up 5 rigs every session).\n\nIf you're going to continue with this you need to drop the needle of you want it to be sustainable. You will be able to control your tolerance much more closely if you have more granular control over your dose (once the plunger goes down you can't suck the drugs back out if it turns out you  didn't need quite as much).\n\nIf for some reason you feel the need to keep IV'ing you're probably already addicted on some level, or you're using the pain of performing the act as some kind of self-obliteration. Either way, it's something to unpack. Any benefits to IV'ing now (reduced cost, bigger rush) will very quickly bounce back in the opposite direction (skyrocketing tolerance can leave you homeless very quickly, and the rush fades away and turns into a struggle to iust feel normal in the blink of an eye)."}

{"body":"Im not sure but I've never had a bad experience while tripping on LSD (granted ive only dropped twice) the whole time I was too amazed by everything, even things that would potentially be scary just made me even happier. All i do is remind myself im on drugs and relax. I can recommend weed (try bud only, indica, not wax or any concentrates) and just chill to music or funny videos. The first time i tripped around 3-4 hours in I smoked a couple of bowls and took an edible and I had an amazing experience. I laughed my shit off at a video called \"3 LSD missionarys try LSD\". The only reason I laughed so hard was because their faces weren't attached and were just floating around. Lol"}
{"body":"Most of the drugs I'm trying to put on the list are supposed to be \"one time\" things, just something I want to experience before I die. But at the same time, it's a coinflip on whether or not I have an addictive personality. As far as weed goes, I could easily start smoking every day or every other day, but I wouldn't really get stoned more than once or twice a week, prob on weekend. Alcohol, again, if i had the option, I would probably only use once every week or two, if that. I've never been reliant on caffeine either, I go weeks at a time of not using it and weeks at a time of relying on it because it'll be a test-heavy week and I need to stay up late a lot. My relationship with nicotine makes me think I dont get addicted easily, because I went from vaping my Juul and Njoy from October of last year until about 3 weeks ago, with 5-10+ stints of a week or two off of it, and other than that first day of being slightly cranky, never felt any withdrawals. As of right now, I don't think I'll end up buying another pod of nicotine for a while, just don't feel like it."}

Plus maryland is basically as blue as they come (I am definitely salty we haven't gone full legal yet).

{"body":"Yeah Ik"}
{"body":"Both are Amphetamines so yes. If you were to roll again I'd advise at least stopping Adderall the day prior. The farther from the MDMA trip the better. Same happened to me having used Meth for months after my last MDMA trip (Candyflip, amazing af) and then tried using MDMA again with another Candyflip. Mistimed the dose for one as my LSD hadn't peaked just yet, dosed just a bit too little LSD, and then tolerance from the Meth made the MDMA experience much less magical. Meth already sorta has an MDMA vibe to it so I've basically just had a long MDMA trip from using Meth extended over weeks instead of all in one day.\n\nPlus I ended up experiencing a bit of Serotonin Syndrome (continued using Meth+MDMA for 3 days total) as well as possibly Cortisol related issues as MDMA+Meth+Not Sleeping= Cortisol out the ass which made me very tired, super puffed up retaining water especially in the face, constipated, and have the constant need to piss but continued inability to empty it fully which was annoying. Also had horrible brain zaps (still got them occasionally these days if I sorta \"think\" a specific way or something like triggering a memory that no longer exists), slept for like 8-16 hrs (total including naps) for the week after since I was also taking a break from Meth, and ate like a madman.\n\nSo yeah if you want to retain the \"magic\" or at least get a good experience out of MDMA you have to make sure to stop other stimulants at least a day beforehand in order to replenish some of your neurotransmitters and sensitivity. A week beforehand being better or at least supplement 5-HTP + EGCG for that week while continuing to use Adderall. Also get proper sleep, eat enough protein, stay hydrated, and try to keep stress levels lowered. Then you should get a good experience next time!"}

{"body":"Unless I'm missing something, schizophrenia is a *psychotic* disorder and not a dissociative disorder. The two are often confused, but if someone has the former, that's when they should absolutely stay away from psychedelics, whereas the risk for people with dissociative disorders is less clear (anecdotally, I have seen some say psychedelics have made dissociative symptoms better while others report them becoming worse or even developing DPDR disorder after psychedelic use)."}

{"body":"I quit cold turkey 10 months ago after 13 years of smoking. There was no way I could have done it by tapering either, as I have very minimal self control. What really helped me was staying as busy as humanly possible, and avoiding the shit out of any triggers. For me that meant no coffee, no going outside, no even going near my porch. I tried to change my routine as drastically as possible to help with the habitual stuff, and I do think that it kind of tricked my brain. I also read a lot about what happens to your body when you quit smoking, and kept track of how many days I had nicotine free and what that meant for my lungs, heart, etc. I avoided absolutely anything stressful for as long as I could, as well. \n\nGood luck! It’s hard AF, and I still have moments when I can’t believe I’m a non-smoker now lol. Just take it day by day and you will get there!"}
{"body":"I don’t think the amount of drug use will increase that dramatically, if at all.  If heroin or cocaine were legal tomorrow, would you use it?  I wouldn’t.  The overwhelming majority of my family, friends and co-workers would not use it.  As for people driving while impaired, that falls into the same category as alcohol.  Alcohol is legal.  Driving while under the influence is not.  The studies I have read about Portugal and Switzerland point to addiction rates staying steady, or even decreasing after certain drugs were decriminalized. I will look into that again.  I AM an advocate of freedom of choice.  The governemnt thinks they know what is best for us and wants to save us from ourselves.  I still cannot forget the NY law that prohibited the sale of soft drinks like Pepsi and Mountain Dew in excess of 16 ounces.  What a joke.  “Okay, I can’t buy a 32 oz soft drink?  Then I’ll take two 16 oz drinks.”  What is next?  Will skydiving be banned?  Flying ultralights?  “That is dangerous.  You can get severely injured or even die.”  Lastly, what I propose is not perfect.  But I think it is infinitely better than our current policies.  Milton Friedman went so far as to say keeping these drugs illegal is not only foolish, it is amoral."}

That said, nothing can quite imitate that universal, transcontinental, 17 year-old wish to get fucked up. I'm too old for it now (never thought I'd say that), but once you've seen it and been it, you can never forget that bottle of White Ace or those cans of Taurus you drank underage that one summer night in the park while the sun started to set and you were all on edge in case the police showed up...\n\n\n17 year-old me was a mashup of mixing vodka an older mate bought us with any mixer we thought would taste okay, beers from my dad, brewing ginger wine by my radiator, and, when times were tough, huffing glue/lighter gas and drinking mouthwash to get wrecked. If 17 year-olds can't *buy* alcohol, and they won't be bought normal booze by responsible adults, they always find a way.\n\nEdit: I was 16 for most of that, but also am from the North of England. If the North can be credited on doing one thing to its purest extreme, it's our intense, almost superhuman will to alter our consciousness, especially when under 18. I will openly challenge any other nation's demographic to go as far as my mates and I did, as often as we did, just to forget our lives for a few minutes.

You can establish such a business in a corrupt country (probably even convince certain politicians to help establish it) and then use that to gain connections to arms dealers, labor etc. Chemical supply could come from China, equipment though is a bit tougher, you'd have to do a fair amount of searching to see what materials you had access to.\n\nYou'd also have to navigate a dangerous web of criminal empires and such so that would be interesting.\n\nAnd definitely have a safe location to fall back to. Probably not in your country of origin if it's a well-developed nation with an even remotely competent intelligence service. They'll probably know what you're up to soon after you begin.

{"body":"If I were you, I wouldn’t take the tramadol. It’s a pain killer and not an anti anxiety medication. Just my 2 cents on the matter. \n\nWith making friends at school and having anxiety, the best thing for you to do is to just be yourself. Unapologetically be who you are, and don’t dwell on the past. You seem like a kind soul with a lot to offer to the world, and I would be doing you a great disservice if I didn’t tell you that it’s in your best interest to seek a councilor that you can speak to. \n\nI was the same as you growing up. Your story is very similar to how I felt, hence why I’m commenting on this thread. I beat my anxiety issues (not all of them) by focusing on making myself better than I was the day before. I keep a journal of all the productive things I do in a day. From cooking meals, to hiking, to working out etc. This has helped me to gain confidence in my abilities as a person and to be able to place my own worth on a higher scale, rather than focus on how I think other people see me. \n\nYou’re young, and I know life is super hard and people can be cruel and scary. But honestly with how bad the world is and with how much you’re going to struggle, you shouldn’t let your own brain torment you the way it is. Making friends will be easy if you make friends with yourself first, and take care of yourself the way you would take care of something or someone that’s helpless. Word of advice: speak to someone who can help guide you away from feeling anxious, and make sure this person can help you learn to love who you are. I hope this helps and I hope you have a great first day at school! Just be you, unapologetically. ��"}
{"body":"There are significant differences between people who use psychedelics like psilocybin and people who don't.  This study finds they're less likely to attempt suicide or require in-patient medical treatment.  Since shroom use accounts for only maybe 100 hours per year out of 8760 hours, this cannot be from just the time that psilocybin or psilocin are in the person's system.  This is in typical use cases, not psychedelic therapy or ceremonial settings.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881114568039\n\nThen there's the long-term changes in the personality domain openness.  Long-term changes to any personality trait are very rare and hard to reproduce, except with psilocybin.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881111420188\n\nAnd then there's the first paper I linked.

{"body":"Yes. Adderall is 75/25 Dextro/Levo, whereas Vyvanse is plain Dextro. Vyvanse has some worse side effects (Like that nausea, dizziness etc) but when it comes to physical toxicity plain Dextro is much better than a mix of the two. 40mg Adderall XR is the same as 30mg Dextroamphetamine, with an extra push from the 10mg Levo (Which doesn't really augment anything but the energy/insomnia).\n\nHowever, Adderall has a lower bioavailability (75-99% IIRC depending on stomach pH) whereas Vyvanse is somewhat more potent since the bioavailability is almost the same as IV(99%). Also, Vyvanse can partially avoid first-pass metabolism (Part of it is converted in the blood) but is less potent by snorting, boofing or injecting it since a lot of it is converted in the pancreas."}

Basically induced from a combo of extended lack of sleep and high levels of dopamine. So exactly what meth does if you keep taking it without long enough breaks.

I don’t mix drugs unless it’s with weed and I only do this with stims and for the comedown of psychs to sleep.  After my binge I’m good for a few months and then just do it again with a new drug or one that I’ve enjoyed in the past. I usually buy a set amount that I’ve determined sober and that will only last me no more than 7 days. I have very severe adhd. And I use drugs to either slow down my thoughts or speed them up. I’ve been told I’m pretty smart, but make stupid mistakes. If you use drugs responsibly and make a plan ahead of time while sober of how much you use. It’s pretty safe. And usually after my binges I feel amazing for weeks. I just feel better about myself and I’m more productive. And I’m very very careful to never use any drugs when I’m upset only when I’m in a good mind set and I could go with or without them so I feel the same way when the binge is over."}

{"body":"Honestly I would say speak to your doctor and perhaps ask for something else for anxiety. I used to have really bad social anxiety to the point I would vibrate a puke. I called it chihuahua mode lol. Tramadol hasn’t helped me with anxiety, but something called Pregabalin has. It’s a drug that works on the same GABA receptors as opioids (tramadol is an opioid if you didn’t already know) and it’s given to people who have generalized anxiety disorder as well as neuropathic pain and seizures. I’ve been prescribed Xanax for really bad anxiety attacks too and that’s been a life saver, but it’s not something you want to mess with if you have an  addictive personality. I’m one of the rare few who use Xanax responsibly.\n\nFurthermore I would recommend delving into the reasons of why you actually have anxiety. Example: Is it because you’re afraid of new people, or something happened in your youth when you met new people? Mental health is a complex subject to try and dissect for any person, but getting to know yourself and why you feel the way that you feel is going to be your first step in finding a way to handle it without drugs. \n\nThat being said, if you have your heart set on trying tramadol for it then you should do it safely. Have you ever taken it before and what dose do you currently have? I would suggest letting a close friend know what you plan on taking, so if anything goes awry then they can help. Make sure you start with a low dose and eat food with it as the food will help it to work and your stomach will be protected."}

It seems that the serotonin depletion comes in two phases, the first one being soon after taking it (but levels had \"returned to control levels\" after 24 hours). A week later, serotonin levels were depleted and there was a reduction in serotonin uptake sites. Note I may have misinterpreted the article though as 1. It's 2:30 AM so my brain isn't really in the best state to read pubmed and 2. I'm not formally educated in pharmacology or brain chemistry, I'm just a 16 year old with an obsession for researching drugs and my level of knowledge isn't fully adequate yet to actually completely comprehend what's being said in these articles (a few of the terms went over my head and it took me a few minutes of reading and googling to get a better understanding of what was being said)\n\nAnyway, (sorry for the tangent, I do that a lot) it does seem to show some pretty serious neurotoxicity in rats, although it's likely not permanent. It's heavy repeated use that tends to cause heavy neurotoxicity, and I believe the \"neurotoxicity\" refers more to it being very detrimental to your serotonin receptors rather than just straight up destroying your neurons."}

Oxymorphone (opana) is *wayyyyy* stronger, and *wayyyyy* better, but you have to snort them or shoot them. If you just take them orally you won’t feel nothing because they are Gel. You have to dremel them down and snort them or shoot them. Dilaudid (hydromorphone) is wayy better than oxycodone too, but you have to shoot them. Fentanyl is pretty good too. But oxymorphone is hands down, the best pill there is. It’s like Percs on steroids. Its pretty much pharmaceutical heroin."}

Once I'd tried heroin, all I'd thought was how good it felt. I was able to not use fault for a few days, so it didn't take much to think everything taught was a lie. I researched the drug, and knew it's addiction potential - and like most people, thought I'd be able to control myself.

And when he pulled up his hologram of the mighty universe with galaxies floating around, I came. Like I have never done before. \n\nThe quality of the soundsystem was out of this dimension  and I could see coloured sound waves coming out of the speakers. \n\nThe lasers and LEDs used by Prydz was almost to much. I had to close my eyes or look straight up at the sealing to avoid overload, atleast that's what it felt like.\n\nTimetable:\n\nI dropped a tab around 4pm and walked around the festival tripping on acid until 7 30 PM. I then dropped half a pill of xtc and was planning on redosing a hour later, but my mate was not.. So I ended up taking the other half just 20 minutes after the first half. \n\nAround something past 8 PM I could feel the pill making its appearance, just as prydz was doing his legendary intro and my mind expanded throughout the universe.\n\n11/10 would recommend and do again."}

A friend of mine’s father has a successful career and family for the same reason, and has also completely stopped his alcoholism in its tracks.

{"body":"It's about having a constructive mindset going into a trip. Because here's the thing. Psychedelics **will** make you feel like shit if you don't address a problem that comes up. For instance, if you see something intimidating or scary in your visuals, you want to keep looking at it. You don't want to look away. The same concept applies for emotions rising up too. It might be a little tough at first, if you accept that having emotions is what makes us human in the first place, you can allow the feelings to come over you in a positive way.\n\nI'd recommend 100ug LSD or 2g of mushrooms if you want to dip your toes in lightly, which would be the smart idea. And then just surround yourself with things/people you enjoy before you trip so that you always have someone/something positive to talk to/look at/do :)."}

{"body":"2CB's a psychedelic, it's got effects like LSD and MDMA in one. I haven't tried any other psychedelics yet, but 2CB is quite nice - it's visuals are very oily like a painting, and it makes walls, edges and textures expand/contract if you focus on them, it's really enjoyable.\n\nIt seems quite hard to get in the rest of the UK (I'm from Northern Ireland) but here it's quite easy, we've got a few plugs who stock 25mg tablets for cheap enough, and 25mg (for me anyway) is enough to get a nice trip for 2-3hrs. Gotta be careful with setting and your company like all psychedelics; the first time I properly tripped on it I done it on a bender and had the craziest, scary trip that I feel some people would not have survived with their mental health intact, lol."}

I've tried using this chart for dosage adjustment with several psychedelics and it has always worked perfectly. Note that the numbers given on the right side of the chart are percentages so you should be able to easily calculate your dosage. If you have diffrent shrooms though this time be sure to take a few less just in case that they are stronger.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: imo 13/14+ days equals about +-0% tolerance so only the 5 days shoud really impact your tolerance"}

{"body":"Uh, big tobacco (Altria) owns juul. And if you don't recognize who those guys are, they're the parent company of Phillip Morris, and something called the 'US smokeless tobacco company'. These dudes are the biggest producers of Tobacco in the USA. \n\nAnd you know Newport cigarettes? They used to be owned by Lorillard, who purchased Blu back in 2012, getting in early on the ecigarette market. They were purchased by Reynolds American (the second largest tobacco company in the USA) in 2015, which got bought by British American Tobacco (Dunhill, Lucky Strike, KOOL, Pall Mall) who later sold Blu to Imperial Brands (Fourth largest in USA, Winston, Backwoods, the Australian Camel market).\n\nSort of the same with how Purdue got sued for being frivolous with the oxycotin prescriptions, and now makes an absolute killing selling Narcan.\n\nThis whole 'big pharma' and 'big tobacco' thing is just a heated phrase that doesn't mean much. These corporations sell both the poison and the cure. They are absolutely NOT interested in banning safer alternatives. They're making a lot of money from ecigarettes, and are loving the current state of things where both can be freely sold. That's why they push for prohibitive laws that introduce large testing fees, to hurt small businesses. What does Altria care if they have to pay a 20,000 fee to get a new flavor out? It won't effect them.\n\nLikewise we're seeing the same thing with the marijuana industry. Just look at Illinois which just legalized marijuana, but requires you to literally be a millionaire to sell it. I forget how much the specific fees/dept of agriculture bonds are but I know you need about 2 million to start selling it. Governor JB Pritzker of IL has yet to release his tax forms, likely using the known loophole that most corrupt politicians use. \"It's not campaign funding, it's a personal gift!\"\n\nYou know who doesn't care about those fees though? Altria, who is now putting billions into pro-legalization lobbying.\n\nThese corporations don't have a singular interest. They want control over everything, and there is seemingly nothing we can do to fight them. They want to crush small business and create a monopoly. Nobody gives a solitary fuck about your health. \n\nSorry for the rant but this shit just makes me so angry."}

{"body":"Very similar story, although miraculously I never had a seizure during withdrawal, but I was more or less cut off cold turkey, by a doctor, in a hospital, from a 6-10mg daily klonopin habit. It sure did suck. Like a month after that, I was \"floxed\" by a week's worth of cipro. It was the fucking worst.  But yet here I am, completely benzo free 6 years later. I have other mental health issues, but anxiety is not really one. \n\nGoing down 1/8mg every week or so should be pretty tolerable. A good friend of mine did a similar schedule, with valium, I believe. It had painful times for him but he was so glad to be off the stuff. \n\nOP - long term benzo use is not really a good thing and it's ok to feel like you need them, but there are some really good ways to manage anxiety in more healthy ways."}
{"body":"Yes. From smoking that STUPID god damn synthetic weed like the idiot I am. \n\nAt the time I smoked a hell of a lot of weed and it basically only had the effect of a mild sedative when someone I was smoking with packed me a bong and insisted it was the coota.\n\nI smoked it, noticed it didn't taste like weed, went to tell my friend that it was shit when everything went purple and my body essentially went into a full blown panic reaction, couldn't breathe, chest pains, muscle spasms, fell on the floor after putting the bong down carefully.\n\nI lay on the floor for half an hour with my hands contorted like fucked up lobster claws with one of my friends freaking the fuck out thinking I was dying and the other explaining what the fuck I just smoked, laughing and telling me it did that to everyone. I just lay there forcing myself to believe I was (going to be) fine and occasionally shouting \"Why would you give me that if you knew it did this you fuuuuck\"\n\nHalf an hour later it became tolerable and I went home and slept it off but FUCK that shit right in the eyes, it was the death, I've not touched any designer drugs since.\n\nTook about a month before I could even remotely feel anything from smoking weed again because my receptors were, I assume, all fucked up."}
{"body":"Yes I love heroin, and I can't do it.....  \n\n\nbut i still do... :O YEET"}
{"body":"Yeah take a quarter dude. Tripping is something you probably should be researching right now but yes you will be fully conscious of the world around you. Acid doesn’t make you see things that aren’t there until you get near the “heroic dose” range (300-400ug+). Many people here will tell you that it’s impossible to have full on hallucinations on acid but it very much is possible, but at 0-200ug you are pretty much guaranteed to be conscious of the world around you.\n\nThere are many things that can happen in a trip dude. Many people may lead you to believe that psychedelics *just* change your vision and headspace. Really though, it is your *perception* that is being altered, not just your *vision*. This includes all 5 of your physical senses and also your *mental* senses. Abstract concepts and imagination can cross the boundaries that normally encapsulate them, allowing you to literally visualize thoughts.\n\nYou can even experience synesthesia, where the *input* of a sensory experience can be offset and mapped to a different *output*. For example, I have literally been able to feel, see, and hear music all at the same time on a high dose of acid. \n\nDose is going to be the biggest factor in your experience but you NEED to take it slow and work your way up. And by that I do NOT mean taking some and then more a few hours later. Take what the experience gives you and use that information to calculate how much you want to take the next time you go down the rabbit hole. \n\nI’ll give you some important beginner tips. 2 weeks is necessary for a full tolerance reset. Do NOT smoke weed for at least the first 5 hours after taking it, and when you do, take a small puff, wait 15 minutes before taking the next for each hit. Personally I think for the first time you shouldn’t smoke at all.\n\nAdditionally, do NOT smoke before your trip or have ANY drugs in your system during the day of the trip. KNOW that you will be forced to be awake for 12 hours past the dosing. \n\nStart a timer at the begging of the trip to keep track of how far you are in. Be in a safe place where you are comfortable and ONLY around people that you REALLY trust. If you feel like venturing outside or anywhere that is more chaotic/less controlled of an environment, do NOT go there until you are at least 3.5-4 hours into the trip. That is the point at which you just hit the peak and are in a much less chaotic headspace.\n\nThe first 3-4 hours is going to be a ride, hang on tight. LSD is very stimulating, you may feel the urge to move around. Sitting still will make you feel anxious if you are prone to that. Just do whatever is necessary to make it through those first few hours. You may experience time dilation, where minutes are stretched and overall get a sense of experiencing much more time. \n\nIf you want to eat anything, it’s pretty much a guarantee you won’t be able to stomach anything that isn’t a fresh fruit or like a smoothie. Eating meat is asking for a bad time. \n\nI could go on about Dos and Donts but truly you will get the hang of it :)"}

{"body":"Anxiety and panic disorder too. Personally I feel so much better after smoking, so if you’re like me I’d absolutely say yes try it out. However do note that some people say weed makes them feel more anxious, but you might not be one of those people, I’m certainly the opposite. \n\nWhile it would be nice to not have to be dependent on a substance, I’d say weed is much safer for frequent and long term use. Benzos should only really be used as a last resort and as temporary treatment. \n\nSometimes I also like to combine regular THC weed with some CBD. I take capsules or tincture but you can buy CBD flower even in illegal states or I’ve gotten CBD carts that are really nice, and it’s instant since you’re inhaling not digesting it so they’re great to smoke on if you feel really anxious in the moment. Also indica strains are probably best, if you’re buying black market you probably won’t always know the strain but I’ve read that most illegal weed is indica because it’s easier and not as tall to grow \n\nWhatever you choose I hope we can both find a way to manage, because it’s hell"}
{"body":"as someone trying my hand at overcoming addiction, here are my 2c.\n\nwhen you begin taking drugs frequently, you will probably find that you make less time for the activities and hobbies you found interesting before. now it’s drugs that consume your leisure time, and after quitting... you’re going to have a lot of free time, and thus a lot of opportunities to relapse.\n\nIf you want to be successful with this, you need to go back to who you were before using drugs and figure out how to get those positive vices back in your life... the other aspects of your life have been suffering such as:\n- Physical\n- Emotional\n- Employment, income, and finances\n- Spiritual and legal \n- Leisure activities \n- Relationships\n\nYou need to figure out what your values are in each category and how you want to live your life.

{"body":"Stay away from drugs. That’s the help I can give you. Bide your time, even if it is extremely difficult. Talk to professionals. Take your meds as directed. Drink 7 glasses of water a day, eat 3 meals, and three HEALTHY snacks (banana, apple, carrot, peach). Try running. Shit helps a lot sometimes. Social media can be good in small doses, but it can warp anybody’s mind if they spent enough time on it. Listen to new albums, and do daily chores while you listen. Melatonin could help with the sleep, as sleep is very important for mental stability. Also, don’t drink pop. Soda is piss water. \nI hope you make your way out of this man, I wish I could be more help, but just don’t try getting on drugs. It’ll make it worse, and you might not be able to get off.

When I came up, I started to feel very alone and sad, but there was this presence that kept \"getting in my face\". It was very strange and distracting, and I remember it feeling like something that wasn't human was breathing on me.\n\nThat's when I realized it was my childhood dog coming to see me one more time, and I just started sobbing. It was insanely emotional for me, but I didn't feel alone anymore.\n\nI'm agnostic, and I've always been comfortable not knowing what I truly believe when it comes to spirits and the divine.

It makes you feel retarded for like 5 minutes max. The taste is horrible, just pure chemical shit taste.\n\nIt works mostly by replacing oxygen which is why it can easily lead to sudden sniffing death (it's actually called that). The hydrocarbons that get you high in inhalants (like butane, propane, and others) break down the mylin sheath that protects the pathways between neurons and nerves. This can lead to increased reaction time, miscommunications between neurons/nerves, general cognitive dampening/damage, it also damages your lungs and blood vessels. It's not worth it.

{"body":"Basically i think the only reason meth becomes unavoidably addictive is due to its neurotoxicity on serotonin, after your brain becomes dopamine upregulated serotonin has to be turned down because high serotonin decreases dopamine activity. Regular dexamphetamine doesnt affect serotonin as heavily and has less neurotoxicity in general, never forget that meth metabolizes into amphetamine so after meth’s balanced effects you get dexamphet’s anxiety induction which usually pushes redosing.

It's the nicotine you crave, but since you're telling yourself that you don't want to vape again, your mind is defaulting to relapsing to other drugs. Like any other human being, you're craving pleasure, especially since you've quit substances that gave you that pleasure constantly. Your situation is a common one so don't fret. Try to do your best to avoid drugs entirely for awhile (couple weeks) without relapsing into anything (including nicotine) and I guarentee you will feel a lot better. The first few days of withdrawal from anything are always the worst."}

{"body":"Yeah man, it was remarkably similar in my days.  Me and my homies were the \"stoners\" of our NorCal school; my friend Z got caught 7 times by the office for possession or smoking weed back in 2010 when it was still illegal, and he A. never got arrested and B. never even got kicked out.  He was just so stereotypical skater/surfer/long blonde hair/super charming california stoner.  Me and my two friends sold lbs of weed, all the E, mushrooms, and LSD at our school.  We were true to ourselves and our friends, but all the most popular kids loved me and us and always wanted to hang out with us.  But we were artsy, creative kids - not sports jocks.\n\nAnyway it was all nature hikes, movies, listening to music, talking about our feelings and helping each other through our personal and familial struggles.  Anyway, out of all of us:\n\nTwo became major drug dealers, like kg level.  One was profiled by the government and family contacted by the government and searched, questioned - thankfully they warned him in time and he isn't in jail for the rest of his life.  He ripped me off for tons of money so we don't speak at all.  Biggest heartbreak of my life.\n\nAnother ODd on drugs a few years ago.  His roommate, another one in the group - dropped off the face of the earth after this and I haven't talked to him since.  Another heartbreak, but less so.\n\nOne is happily living at his fathers house as a 27 year old growing weed and discovering himself in life again.\n\nand I became a massive drug addict after my father passed in my final semester senior year at Uni, I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and my best friend in the world, and then finally got clean about a year and a half ago.  I live with my mother now as I rebuild my life post drug addiction.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nSo out of a tight group of 5 kids who went through thick and thin, one is unscarred and happy, and another is very scarred and happy, and I am quite scarred and happy.  The lives we live now are SO vastly different to what we expected at these years, it fucking kills me."}

Towards the end/comedown I kind of started getting anxious about my heart, but I did go to the cardiologist to get my VSD looked at. \n\nThey did an echo and it turns out my VSD got slightly bigger (which is almost never the case, they usually get smaller or close on their own, which my pediatric cardiologist thought would happen.) The doc said it looked like my heart tried to repair itself but it didn’t connect the tissue. As for the anxiety, they had me wear a heart monitor for the palpitations (which they called me back about, and said they were normal PVC’s), but the cardiologist DID say that I was a candidate for surgery to get the hole closed.\n\nI have to go in and do a stress test and cardiac MRI soon, and they’re gonna bring my case/info to a team of cardiologists to see if they want to operate or just leave me be. Personally, I would rather have the surgery and get it over with. But we’ll see how it pans out."}

{"body":"The problem is that \"safe\" and \"dangerous\" are completely meaningless. The damage any drug can cause depends on how it's used and the person using it. There are also different types of risk.\n\nSome drugs are easy to fatally OD on, some are almost impossible to OD on. Most drugs don't cause any toxicity below a certain dose, some (like alcohol) are toxic at any dose. Some have a risk of triggering disorders in predisposed people, some don't. Most are physiologically very damaging in chronic use, others (like heroin) aren't. Some are very addictive, some arent very addictive at all. Some can have very unpredictable and difficult to control effects, like psychedelics. Some can have potentially dangerous effects on behaviour, like alcohol.\n\nDrugs arent safe or dangerous. Heroin can be used in such a way that it won't cause any damage at all. LSD can fuck your brain in a single normal dose but usually won't. Cannabis can impair your cognition long-term if you use it in a certain way. A little MDMA once every 3 months will be completely harmless to the vast majority of people, but if you have a heart condition or you're in a hot environment it could easily kill you."}

{"body":"Nah I just have underlying Narcolepsy I believe. Worsened of course by Meth.\n\nAnd true. I've experienced such in the past with a different batch. This one, not so much. Only recently and really it isn't hallucinations since it's quite literally present. Unlike LSD visuals that come and then go after the trip, these come much the same and then stick around. [For some examples](https://www.imgur.com/a/gCren1A). Clouds looking like people on like trains or something? Similar visuals showed on my floor and mouse mat. Faces showing up in random places, literally. Even in the clouds too as you can clearly see lips/nose. As well as these colored lines (accompanied by sound, so visual sound waves that were moving). I would say sleep doesn't \"make it go away\" in so much as it sorta stops while I wake up. Lately it'd worse if I sleep where I literally forget who I am, what I am, for like a little while. Like a balloon that deflates completely and wakes up slowly inflating wondering what the fuck is happening."}

{"body":"With no tolerance I do 600-800mg (pregab), all at once. Redosing doesn't to do much of anything, plus it takes ages to kick in in the first place. I make sure I haven't eaten and around 1 hour after dosing I grab myself a coffee or energy drink, caffeine seems to enhance the effects. The best I've felt on it was when I took like 1G with not much tolerance, it felt incredible. Almost like molly in the way the music sounded so good. Also in regards to the muscle spasms, it seems not everyone gets them. Since it's partly a seizure medication I think I'm getting paradoxical effects, I've spoken with people who never got anything like that. Another thing to keep in mind is that for withdrawals to actually happen you need to take this stuff daily for like weeks (binging pregab is one of the funnest things ever, too bad the tolerance skyrockets after like 3 days) and even then apparently around 50% just don't get any withdrawal while the rest experience prolonged hell. I have a friend who withdrew for a fucking year from this stuff. There's a lot of unknown aspects to this well known drug lol."}

Just talk about your experiences and explain set and setting and why it matters. Your brother doesnt sound like he would trip unless he fully understands how safe and normal it is to use psychedelics. Mention how deeply rooted it is in our culture. Once he understands all of this, he will at least be open to the idea hopefully. Once he sees you tripping and how normal you are it might be enough to convince him to try it himself.\n\nYou take a tab and enjoy nature, you dont get geeked out of your mind and end up in some other dimension.

And smoking pot (which teens  tend to love) on it makes it so much more intense which makes things worse.\n\nMany people get DP/DE from dissos, and in particular DXM for some reason. The day(s) after a level 3 or 4 tri\\[p leave you feeling detached and empty (some find it enjoyable cuz you feel floaty though).\n\nNot to mention teens arent going to care if it's tripple C's or apap or guaf, they just want to get high.

{"body":"No hah I'm just speaking from personal experience. There's many people who will just get one or two of these. It's pretty rare to get all of them though so it's funny that some people think they're all the same. I've had the phenomenon of cannabis becoming more psychedelic after and I've had a *legit* flashback before but I've definitely never had HPPD. Not even mildly. I've met and known people with HPPD and their symptoms just seem starkly different from anything I've personally seen or felt and none of them even had \"flashbacks\". And a flashback is different from just weed being trippier because they are so short-lived and you're fully tripping again. You're essentially back in the trip. It's not just a memory, it feels neurological and sudden. Flashbacks also have triggers and my flashback happened only 7 days after the trip and it was in the same setting, sitting on the same couch with the same people, etc.\n\nIt's probably going to be awhile before science figures this stuff out or even begins to recognize all 3 of these things as separate phenomena because even in the psychedelic community many people assume they are the same. And from what I've read scientifically, they're kind of going in the wrong direction. The researchers. I think I even remember reading that the DSM diagnostic is now trying to combine the side effects of HPPD and flashbacks together and it just makes me cringe because they're all on the outside looking in and probably have no clue about the experiences themselves since they're just straight scientists with little to no phenomenological firsthand experience. All I can tell you is that as someone who's had a real legit flashback before, I've never ever had HPPD.\n\nThe misunderstanding is simply an assumption. I would probably assume they're the same thing as well if I didn't experience and learn myself. I'm very scientific-minded so I'm pretty confident with my assessment and I think if more scientifically-minded people looked into this or had their own experiences they could make more sense of it."}

Obviously tramadol affects everyone definitely but this can definitely be my cup of tea if that feeling is guaranteed everytime.

You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports\n\nAs a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try.

When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. \n\nYou will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.\n\n[Post removed]\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"Hey I'm hella new to reddit (like signed up T-1 second ago) so I'm still working it out. OK, So i'm a semi-recent stoner, (every now and again until 6 months ago when I started blazing daily) It's provided huge positive effects outside of the high and i'm honestly loving it. The one thing I have found tho is that drinking is just not good anymore. I find the taste of alcohol really bad (admittedly i'm a broke 18 year old so i'm probably drinking some dusty stuff) and I don't really feel the effects either. Like i'll drink till I munt (like in the range of 15 standards in under an hour and i'm pretty short) but I just don't really feel any different like at most slightly looser. This might not make sense but the only way my cooked brain can describe it is drinking is like looking at those black to white gradient pallet things and smoking bud is like looking at the whole rainbow pallet ones, if that makes any sense.  I don't know if this is related to the smoking or it's just because my general drug tolerance has higher standards than 6 months ago (it been a hectically good 6er)    \n\nLots of Love, JIJ"}

And its not just the effects of it i kind of crave/miss its everything surrounding it too, as most of my day was taken up either trying to get it or taking it.  Some of the things I did to raise money for it as well as actually having to go and get it was exciting and gave me kind of a buzz, and their are times when I'm just sitting at home watching TV or something like that not really doing anything in particular when I'll miss the actual 'adventures' I used to get into, although when I stop and think about it, I'm glad i'm where I am now"}

I’m tripping balls so I ran in the houses I had 2 choices, grab the bat or the .38 . I grabbed the bat my buddy tackled him and I beat the living piss out of him . The sound of the bat hitting the guys head , I knew I went to far but not at the time , I was angry and yeah , dude never told on me though ��‍♂️ he went to the hospital and everything police were looking for me at first because this was in broad day light . And people gave my description but I ran away , to this day the guy has changed his life around I beat with the bat .  He’s a god fearing man now ."}

For example, mom would call me at like 2 am asking “hey it’s late when will you be home?” And I’D FLIP! “STOP FUCKING CALLING ME? MOM.!” and I’d hang up. \n\nInhindsight, that was so embarrassing.

{"body":"Hello /u/sapnorocky, if it's your first time with a new substance, check out our Wiki pages on [**common drugs**](/r/Drugs/wiki/drugs) and the [**drug knowledge base**](/r/Drugs/wiki/knowledgebase) or use the search option to the right and then feel free to come back with any unanswered questions. You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports\n\nAs a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. \n\nYou will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.\n\n[Post removed]\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"\n\u0026gt;\"Yoyo was staring at the guy from a safe distance and told Xenu that under no circumstances would this thing enter the van while he (Yoyo) was in it. The guy didn't seem bothered by this at all. He and Xenu negotiated a suitable reward for Captain Cunt's services at the fairground - 6 bottles of pear vodka and 6 vials of (I think) rohypnol did the trick. At that time I didn't know about its reputation, but I feel sick just thinking of that now, aaah!\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"Anyway, the guy has his own car, a beat-up Lada with huge mirrors on the sides; probably for a caravan or animal trailer, poor beasts. We're to follow him to the fairground, and once there let him do a tour of the grounds to make sure there's no one else there. So off we go, and Yoyo just keeps staring at Xenu for actually knowing a walking rubbish tip of a human being. Can't help feeling the same, but I suppose you can't always choose your acquaintances.\"\n\n\u0026gt;Alas, no.\n\n\u0026gt;\"Very funny. I'm serious about this man, though. If it weren't for all the clothing - another 3-layer advocate, you get that a lot here - I'm sure his odour would have caused mass nausea. Yoyo must have been thinking along those same lines, cause he flipped down the ventilation slots and insisted on closing the windows. Xenu was pretty embarrassed by the way, poor guy.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"So we get to the fairground and Captain Cunt does his thing. It's hard to see in the minimal lighting, but there's a merrygoround, a teacup ride, dodgems, etc.; basically the smaller attractions, no big rides. Not sure a roller coaster in our condition would be a good thing anyway. Yoyo heads straight for the dodgems (bumper cars), me too - always my favourite. They're far too small for Xenu to get in, so he goes scouting for leftovers by - I hope inside - the foodstalls. They're closed, but hey, we paid our booze \u0026amp; drugs entry fee!\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"Riding the bumper cars is really weird without the music and crowd noise. There's just this zoom and crackle from the electricity and the sound of the wheels on the floor. The crashes are more spectacular though. Yoyo has no chance, cause he's got joose and whatnot coming out of his ears. At some point he ploughs through all the unoccupied cars in the corner, shouting at imaginary drivers to get out of the way. Come to think of it, it must be the mushrooms.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"So after I almost send him flying out of his car from a brilliant sideswipe if I say so myself, he's having trouble finding the wheel and I take him back to the booth, where the Captain is going through drawers and anything that might hold a few coins. Really disgusting. I mean, we may have been a bit out of line on occasion, but we didn't steal. Well, no money. At least I don't think so. I didn't. Yoyo looks at the guy with renewed repulsion - I suppose the mushrooms were indeed working now - and pulls on a flap of his vest. I think that's where the knife is, so I pull him away to go and find Xenu. The Captain follows at a distance.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"I can't remember the details, but I had this utterly weird conversation with Yoyo while we were looking for Xenu. He was tripping hard, and I'd always heard you should be nice to people on hallucinogenics, agree with them and all. So he forbids me from 'naming things', avoiding nouns, that is. I immediately thought of the smurf comics, so I asked if smurf was okay. He asks what's a smurf, so I sort of try to explain that smurfs are little smurfs who live in a smurf in the smurf, a bit like smurfs, but smurfless and blue and with funny smurfs on their smurfs. He didn't say anything for a while, except moan a bit, so I quickly told him don't worry, smurfs aren't real. Then we find Xenu mucking about in a hamburger stand. Not real hamburgers like american hamburgers, just flattened chunks of ground pork in batter.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"He's making a meat sculpture with the hamburgers, which apparently were just lying around instead of in a fridge, eek. Yoyo's observing this and says make a smurf and put it on your smurf. I explain to Xenu what's happening and he starts holding hamburger meat against his body till Yoyo cries 'oh yeah' when the meat's on Xenu's head. So he (Xenu) kneads a big blob into a ball and punches it till it looks more or less like a flat cap and puts it on. Yoyo's delighted and starts making pictures with an invisible camera; Xenu's happy with the success.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"That's when the lights around the merrygoround come on and Captain C. starts waving at us to join him. Yoyo kind of stiffens every few yards as we approach Stinkenstein; hindsight and all, but we really should have known something was going to go wrong there. The Captain sees Xenu's meat helmet and starts making disgusting remarks. I'm not at all the feminist type, but this guy's vulgarity and total lack of taste was just repulsive. I was getting mad at the guy too; perhaps that's why I didn't see anything wrong with Yoyo's growling like an animal.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"The merrygoround had these little seats on chains that would swing outward as it picked up speed; must have been really old, cause I remember they made a fuss about a similar one in Germany, safety standards, etc. Captain Crud had climbed on after putting the machinery in motion and - I swear this is true - was creating a cloud of body odour with every revolution.\"\n\n\u0026gt;Cumulonimbus stincus...\n\n\u0026gt;\"I'm not kidding, I had to step at least 10ft back. It got worse with the increasing speed. Xenu was actually ready to go then; said we should leave the guy on his pong mill and get the hell out - just leave the machine on, haha. We were talking about that when Yoyo went crazy.\"\n\n\u0026gt;You mean crazIER.\n\n\u0026gt;\"No, crazy. Really off. Screaming in tongues, foaming at the mouth, eyes rolling around like pool balls. Xenu was so startled, he was looking around as if to find the thing or agent that had set him off. I ran to the nearest foodstand to get on the roof, cause an uncontrollable Yoyo was frightening. Now I didn't see exactly how it happened, cause I'd only just got on the roof - and ripped my pants on the broken glass stuck in a supporting beam - but when I looked up Yoyo was on the ground holding a piece of building iron (rebar) and the Captain was hanging from one of the chains previously attached to his seat, which was now dangling on the other chain. I suppose Yoyo had tried to land a tremendous blow on the guy, but had hit the link that held the seat. The guy was hollering like a maniac, but nobody did anything. Yoyo thrashing on the ground, with Xenu trying to approach him from a safe angle.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"Anyway, it only took 1 or 2 turns for the guy to lose his grip, of course. The thing is just that it happened the moment he went past the entrance booth and he slammed right into it. I'm probably just imagining this, but when I see it in my mind there's a sound like a giant slurping his soup. Or a ton of fish dropped from some height, comical but horrible too.\"\n\n\u0026gt;In the US they have a breakfast cereal called Captain Crunch.\n\n\u0026gt;\"Oh this was more like a wet thud, actually just horrible, not comical. Xenu was yelling to me to get the hell off the roof and give him a hand with Yoyo, but I had to improvise a skirt with my torn jeans (hurray for cheap) first, and Yoyo was sort of slithering towards the guy.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"I got closer but stayed behind Xenu. Captain Cunt was rolled up at the foot of the booth, and had actually - again, I swear - left a trail of goo on the wall, like a slug full of cheese and blood. It was absolutely disgusting and I almost threw up. Yoyo was poking him with the iron, still blubbering nonsense; and Xenu pulled him back by the scruff of the neck.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"I couldn't see his head or his hands, he looked like leftover parts at the human body plant. I didn't know if we should call someone or just get the fuck away from this. Whichever way it would turn out in the end, the cops were inclined to shake you down and give you a hard time in general when there's any doubts about your case. But then Xenu tossed his hamburger hat on the heap of clothes and Yoyo started moaning again (maybe he thought he'd bagged a smurf), and I knew we weren't going to explain this to a pair of pissed off cops. So we took Yoyo by the arms, dragged him to the van, threw him in the back, and got the hell out. Pheeewww!\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"After we'd put a good distance between us and the fairground, Xenu wanted to look at Yoyo, so we parked on the death strip - we were back on the peripheral - cause the little window to the back was all steamed up. That idiot Yoyo was building a fire in the lorry! He somehow seemed much better though, over the hump as they say. He was speaking normal words again and I think he'd thrown up in the corner. Anyway, he was going to roast 'Wiener Wuerstchen' (Viennese sausages) he had in one of his vest pockets. Xenu had enough now, though. He emptied 2 whole bottles of antifreeze over Yoyo's head and slapped him a few times. Confiscated the sausages, naturally. Yoyo was exceptionally tame for a while after that. We took him back to the cab and I turned on his ghettoblaster, put a little Neil on his wounds.\"\n\n\u0026gt;\"We felt we had to get Yoyo in better shape, so we went back to that place I told you about earlier, with the fish pond. There was nobody else around now, so we dumped Yoyo in the pond (very cold, believe me) and sort of rinsed him for a bit, like laundry, you know. Xenu had 2 of his coveralls in the back, so we put those on Yoyo and stuffed everything soft and malleable we had in, cause they were 3x Yoyo's size and we didn't want him to catch his death. We'd taken his boots off before he went in the water, so that was okay. He looked like an obese cosmonaut, or you know those fake rubber fat suits they sell for carnaval (shrovetide/mardi gras)? He had to get in the back, of course. But at least he was sober.\""}

{"body":"Just speaking from my experience. Most people I know who were using benzos got heavily physically addicted to them. They did not seem to have problems drinking alcohol but somehow taking benzos changed them even though it affects the same receptors in the brain.\n\n\u0026gt; you make it seem like no matter how you use them they are evil and shouldn’t be touched. Once again, if used right your gooood to go and it’s safe and effective.\n\nThat's up to debate how much how often exactly is safe ? You have no idea until your'e in a PAWS struggling on months to no end. Like I said some benzos have stupidly long half life (diazepam, clonzaepam) and even taking them twice in week in medium to high doses can leave you vulnerable.\n\nWith other drugs upon cessation you get a hangover, you become sick but you become sober for one month and nearly of the symptoms go away . This does not apply to GABA agonists - you have no idea how much you can handle until it's too late.\n\nI agree my wording might be a little extreme but I was trying to get my point across that benzos are one hell of a different beast. My drug experience is quite vast and with most of them I have barely any negative consequences health-wise compared to benzos. Yes I was abusing them later down the road but overall I used approximately 2-3 packs worth of 30x2mg clonazepam, one xanax 0.5x30 box and 10 mg of clonazolam in a 6 month span and I was not using them daily. ( I keep a chem diary)  Is that really that much ? Maybe but I also used way more codeine amount wise and currently when I'm not using I feel completely fine minus the mental addiction it left me."}

{"body":"Opinions from someone who has used LSD over 85 times, and mushrooms around 20.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nLSD is easier to handle especially in higher doses, you can go with the flow easily so you can use it at a festival or in group settings easier. You can talk to someone on 5 tabs and not be a jibbering puddle. Great with friends.\n\nShrooms can be difficult because it really uncovers your psyche. Better for solo trips in nature, just you and the forest. Tripping with others on shrooms is more difficult because you can really get stuck in your own head.\n\nLSD has a very uplifting, colorful, energetic, playful headspace whereas shrooms has a spiritual, deep, introspective, confusing headspace. This means on shrooms, set n setting is more important. You cant hide from your emotions easily on shrooms. 100ug is going to give you a full on LSD experience, and 200ug is literally just double the effects. 1 gram of shrooms is going to get you stoned like a strong edible would, 2 grams is comparable to 100ug of lsd, and 3.5g and above is a mindfuck.\n\nVisualls on LSD are hands down better, especially at lower doses. Way more colorful, tons of fractals, everything melts/goops/warps/spins, patterns galore, and it offers an eye candy experience.\n\nVisuals on shrooms are much less intense, until you get to 5 grams or more and then it gets in DMT level shit. Darker, earthy colors, simple geometric patterns on surfaces, grass and trees look more \"organic\", but overall much less visual than LSD. Under 1.8-2 grams of shrooms, and you likely wont get any visuals.\n\nLSD has more linear dosing in terms of effects, whereas shrooms effects get much stronger as you go up in dose. Taking twice as much shrooms is like taking a different drug, taking twice as much acid is like taking twice as much acid.\n\nMusic is also way better on LSD. It just sounds magical, and paired with the visuals it is mindblowing. Turn on some tunes and watch as sound turns into colors and feelings and patterns. Once you do LSD, you realize just how much ifluence it has had on music for decades.\n\nMusic on shrooms to me is just different. It's not better or worse than sober, it just hits the ear differently. It doesnt really flow with the beat of music, it makes it choppy and distorted. Id rather hear the birds and wind blowing.\n\nI've passed out 2 seperate times on shrooms. Once in the shower, hit my head hard on the tile. Other time i was listening to music sitting down 8 hours after dosing but i suddenly felt a massive head rush, vision went white, ringing in my ears, and thought I was gonna faint or even die. Never happened with LSD."}

{"body":"The optimum conditions for storage of chemicals is cold, dry, dark and oxygen-free.\n\nThe more of these criteria you can meet, the better. It's recommended to use a sealed container inside a freezer. Stored in this way, drugs will outlive you.\n\nWorth noting though, if you remove drugs from the container while still cold, they will attract condensation, which is to be avoided. The best way to avoid this is to leave them in the sealed container until they reach room temperature.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Prolab has some really cheap bottles on Amazon. They're tablets so you can bite them in half when you're off the other stuff and no longer need the full 200mg.

{"body":"Prepare to dissociate entirely after the Nitrous for a small period and slight intensification of the ketamine high. Overall I like it. Candyflip + Ketamine + Nitrous was probably the most euphoric a human being can be while also feeling like the entire universe. Like going from the tiniest \"thing\" to the largest in existence and back again like a loop. But with waves and waves of euphoric bliss each time. Especially with this sense of understanding that we are everything and our \"current\" incarnation is the middle point between the two extremes. It's just wonderful.\n\nWith Nitrous make sure to breathe some oxygen every now and then. My method is breathe in a single, sip a bit of oxygen, hold 15s, breathe back into balloon, breathe one or two full breaths of air and back out, breathe in balloon, hold 10-15s, breathe out, breathe air, load next cart, etc.\n\n**UDPATE: Also as a side note, Nitrous tends to intensify over time and sorta expands on itself. Things start off small, quick, hilarious, euphoric, fun, etc. Slowly it moves to existential, reality defying, reality *bending*, euphoric though at times scary/strange/weird, and more drawn out and experienced. Right now Nitrous basically makes me feel like I'm creating a mini reality based on my surroundings and then I'm able to manipulate it in such a way that I'm basically manipulating \"reality\" (in so much as the reality I'm currently perceiving). I did some earlier today with my cousin and during parts of the high he'll go in and then I'll go in and while I'm breathing in the balloon (literally AS I'm breathing it) it's like he sorta pauses like an NPC. The further I breathe it in he sorta moves and such like I'm watching a weird stop motion reality and he's breathing *out* into his balloon once I'm done breathing in mine. And then he'll begin to pass out while I'm still hyper-aware (Meth+Nitrous feels like a selfish version of Nitrous alone/with other dissos) and sorta just blank out entirely at a point like my entire reality has become only me. This entire time I can see these colored outlines coming out of me affecting the surrounding reality which I can manipulate and use it to make him move over and stuff. Which in my head I found scary/selfish/*evil* so I stopped myself breathed oxygen and such and then he got up like normal again. Then finished the rest of the Nitrous trying to \"forget\" how I did that so I don't somehow use it and break my reality or something which worked I guess. Weird shit man. Use sparingly unless you're prepared to delve DEEEEP into the fabrics of reality and your grasp on it.**"}
{"body":"That's a commendable attitude, but as someone diagnosed with ADHD later in life (only after I failed out of college) I will say drugs can make a world of difference for ADHD as well.\n\nIdeally, if he is diagnosed, the first thing to try is getting some coaching on things like how to properly study, and make use of various tools to help with the organizational problems that come with ADHD. If, even after trying the therapy and coping skills learned through that stuff, he's still having a hard time, it might be worth considering medication. ADHD can have a variety of different effects, and everyone is different. Some people absolutely need the medication.\n\nSo my advice is don't completely rule out the possibility of medication."}

I got on methadone so I could learn how to live like a normal human being; people looking in from the outside really don’t understand this, but when your addicted to drugs for a period of years, the *lifestyle* becomes addicting. So many people are addicted to the lifestyle and not really the drugs. I had been addicted to drugs from a young age (14-22 years old) so I didn’t really know who I was, or anything about living normally; I just knew that lifestyle and I loved it, and if you want to stay away from the dope you have to give up the lifestyle too."}

I think acid is a bit better because\n1 tab gives you a full trip but is easy to control and with shrooms you need an eight to really trip but that can be too much to handle for your first time because shrooms are in their nature harder to handle.

I’ve always found even my most intense shrooms trips to be more euphoric than a good acid trip- acid to me feels like however you feel, will increase x 50 (good, bad, etc ) while shrooms feels like it’s own unique emotion. explorative and (for lack of a better word) groovy"}

{"body":"Society exists as a collective agreement to facilitate fulfilling our primal urges/desires (reproduction and accumulation of resources) in the most efficient way possible for everyone. We think civilization has freed us from the rule of the jungle, but really it's only streamlined the same process into a civilized orderly manner. Competition for resources obviously still exists, it just happens through exchanges in money rather than physical dominance. Not to mention that the rule of the jungle still applies to every non-human species, with the human as the Apex predator. We're not all that different from the rest of the animal kingdom, we've just agreed to stop killing each other (for the most part) in the pursuit of our individual animalistic goals, and have developed a system (rule of law) that we all agree to uphold in order to maintain that status quo. Screw all the other animals though, they can get fucked. \n\nThe point of explaining this rather obvious idea is to say that by immersing yourself deeper into human society and ignoring your less evolved \"primal side\", you're not really going away from your animalistic desires, you're just fulfilling them in the way society has structured for you. Everything that makes us human can be found in society, because our society is intrinsicly natural. We've just managed to sufficiently insulate ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom so much that now most people falsely see a hard division between the \"human\" and the \"primal\". Don't be fooled though, as long as you desire resource accumulation and a mate, the only thing separating you from the hunter gatherer is your fancier tools and an agreement with the tribe next door to not kill each other over the last pack of hot dogs at the supermarket.\n\nThe only real philosophjes/ways of life that I would classify as non-human or non-natural are the societal renunciate religions such as Buddhism, which preach a total removal of all desires and basically ask it's devote followers to strip away all that it means to be human, leaving behind their bare naked karmic essence which is then free to reintegrate into the universe, liberated of all it's primal chains. This is true spiritual enlightenment (as defined by Buddhism) and these chains that keep you from it are built of desire, of lust and hunger, and of even the very matter that makes up your body and central nervous system. Basically religions like Buddhism ask you to stop being human entirely, and check out of existence, ending your genetic lineage  and stopping the cycle of life. That's the most unnatural thing I can think of, completely going against everything that human society and the greater animal world actively strive to achieve; the continuation and perpetuation of itself."}

{"body":"Sounds like you were in the right mindset and place to experience something more of the true nature that the spirit of the cannabis can give.  \n\n\nI would still be wary of what the plant spirit tells you and take it with some salt, I've read experiences with people who have been in deep relationship with the plant (addiction) and what different shamans have told them about the plant, and I've seen a common theme of them describing cannabis \"as not something to trust 100%\".  \n\n\nI see the plant spirit giving us what we ask from it, many times people just use it and abuse it ultimately, escape from reality, like I have done also on so many occasions, over many years, but when really approaching the plant with the honor and a ritualistic approach, and taking bigger amounts (eg. smoking lots raw weed vs vaporizing, or eating lots) and then just praying and chanting for many hours for healing and vision, the plant has shown me it's true healing properties.  \n\n\nBut at the same time, it seems to have this \"dependent\" factor to it, like somehow it wants to keep working with us, living through us, and this can be seen maybe as an evolutionary trait, a way to survive even through the winters, making us humans grow it in our basements, indoor etc, and giving us it's power.  \n\n\nSo I would be wary of whatever the plant tells you about \"being in control of other substances\", this might be just part of the mind games the spirit of the plant likes to play.  \n\n\nBut congrats on seeing a completely new side of the plant. What I would say also based on my deep experience with the spirit of this plant, is that you want to be very wary, very careful in which ways it calls you or lures you into it's arms, it's not always a healthy relationship that forms there, as can be seen from the numerous people who get addicted and just give their power to the plant, ultimately getting lazy and non-productive from that act."}

I personally find mushrooms easier to handle than weed in general.\n\nAnd no, you're not stupid for being interested in LSD/psychedelics, they have huge potential, and when used correctly, are some of the safest drugs out there.\n\nThere are risks though, so make sure you know what you're doing and follow harm reduction practices (don't do it alone, test the tabs, start with a low dose, etc.). Do your own research!\n\nYou could also consider mushrooms or a legal (depending on where you live) LSD analogues instead of regular LSD, depending on what you're looking for.

But I think you’ll be able to figure things out and what’s going on and if she accepts help from you or keeps saying she’ll take care of it or she’ll do it but you can only do so much.  It is up to her. And it will get harder, trust me, if things don’t change or improve. You also need to focus on yourself too and not make your life everyday about herand wondering where she is or what she’s doing etc. it’ll start to take over your life. And I know you can’t not worry . But good luck to you both, i hope things improve for you and her and if not, then I think you know what you’ll need to do. Xox"}

{"body":"Yes, you shouldnt make fun of someone who is suffering so badly that they turn to heroin. Is that really a difficult concept for you to grasp? I never said all instances of self medicating are good for you or acceptable, but comparing self medicating with heroin to weed is just stupid and not a good analogy. Heroin will make your life far far worse. But even so, the answer is not to mock the person. \n\nYes, some people use gaming as a crutch, but for many of them, whats the alternative? Sitting inside and doing nothing or trying to fit into a world that has already rejected them, whos to say any of that is better than playing video games? I have austism, and video games in moderation are a great way for me to relax and get a short break from the raging torrent of the intensity of my anxiety and sensory input-related dysphoria. Its not a bad thing to have a crutch as long as you dont let it take over your entire life, i used to be addicted to video games and i agree with everything you said there but it seems like youre missing part of the picture. Sometimes you really do need a distraction when the world gets too ugly too constantly, the same could be said of hanging out with friends, it distracts you from whatevers on your mind.\n\nChagyam Trungpa rinpochet, a buddhist teacher, would bring his students to the bar and make them drink and smoke to their heart’s content. His idea was that people have to get it out of their system because they have to realize on their own that theyre better off without it. You can tell them, but it wont be the same as first hand experience. It wont hold that weight. \n\nBut the point of smoking weed isnt to cure yourself, its to moderate your consciousness as you see fit, to make your brain function in a way that works for you, which should be a right. Many people will NEVER feel better in the long term and this is the best we have. Not everyone with depression will find a cure, the vast majority of serious cases will have it for life. Medication is not well enough understood for it to reliably work, same with psychotherapy to be honest. Either way, most medications dont cure you, most medications you have to take every single day or else they dont work. How is that any different? They dont cure you either.\n\nWhat do you do when youre suffering horribly, when the mental healthcare system has failed you? You turn to something that works. Screw anyone who gives you shit for it."}

{"body":"Sounds like pseudoephedrine plus antihistamine. The pseudofed will be similar to a shittier version of an amphetamine buzz, but bromphen is an antihistamine/anticholinergic like DPH.\n\nAntihistamines can definitely alter your consciousness but not in a good way. You’ll be delirious and probably very out of it, and you might even have realistic hallucinations. The main negative effects from my experience are feelings of grogginess, heavy and gross body high, memory impairment, restless leg syndrome, and an inability to produce saliva or relieve your bladder. Also, antihistamines are correlated to cognitive issues later in life, such as dementia.\n\nIs it worth it? Probably not. Doing it once or twice is not gonna kill you or do any damage most likely, but you might not enjoy it. I would suggest looking into something like bronkaid because it has the pseudofed without the antihistamine."}

Weird thing is, I only ever had a good experience on one occasion when taking that dose, with all other things (other psych meds) being equal. No idea why."}
{"body":"I always justified using it over MDMA because even though it might be more toxic it was also more potent. So I would need less MDA than MDMA so I felt like it evened out. \n\nPlus MDA didn’t seem to take an emotional toll the next few days. I always got an afterglow instead of a comedown. And a better high overall IMO."}
{"body":"First time I tried meth,  I bought a gram for $15, had a line and gave the rest to a friend. Batch didn't do much for me and 5 hours later I was out for the night. Was frequent in popping ecstasy once a month prior to that.\n\nEdit: \n\nGood on you OP for least trying educate those that are new to the subject. May I suggest a bit more tact in the future?"}

{"body":"Your first high is the same first as anything. You'll never experience a video game, movie or food for the first time again and those times are always the best times. While the high is still the same high, it won't feel as good because your brain and body both know exactly what to expect.\n\n2 months is safe though, people say 2-3 months just for extra precautions but yes, you are fine waiting 2 months between rolls you're just better off waiting 3 months. Your serotonin recovers after a month, the extra 2 months is to allow it to \"stabilize\" in a way and just make sure it's at max levels."}
{"body":"Which strain of kratom?  White?"}
{"body":"I agree with that now. Our difference may be in how informed we believe the general population to be or how seriously they take the information about addiction before they are addicted. A lot of people don’t believe addiction would happen to them and that casual use is harmless until they realize it’s gonna be almost unbearably uncomfortable to get off the drugs after a certain point. \n\nAlso many drug users start that life pattern before adulthood and if you know teens, decisions about risky behaviors isn’t their strongest subject. \n\nAgain a grown-ass man that wants to shoot up heroin is only doing a disservice to himself and his family/friends so I understood the point about letting him do what he wants. But when those guys start dying off from overdoses and erasing hope for a better life, I don’t blame society for wanting to address that problem with legislation and fining corporations profiting from addiction. \n\n\nAlso I agree about the drug charges/etc"}

I'm not religious but there are a lot of principles to Islam that really appeal to me. Alcohol abstinence being one that, you should agree, makes sense. Why do people in North America think it's actually okay to put alcohol in your system? It destroys you. If you actually were living a life with any meaning, you shouldn't even need to think about alcohol. North America is fucked."}

{"body":"I wish I had a consistent plug so I could try that"}
{"body":"I didn't mean that last part to be harsh I just don't like people spreading misinformation."}
{"body":"Yes I used to snort so much adderall that it makes me nauseous just thinking about it. It hits much harder but  not worth the risks. Pills usually weight 100s of mg so if you snort a 10mg Ritalin then you snorted 100s of mg of filler for 10mg of the active chemical. Shit just clogs up your sinuses and causes all kinds of damage. Is definitely fun tho haha."}
{"body":"Aright thanks man, do you think oil will do a sufficient job of helping the comedown?"}
{"body":"I astral projected/died from a NO2-Acid combo, completely lost all sense of my body, all I could see was stars and nebula, the moment I realized I was out of my body I began to fall back to earth I had an I overwhelming sense of relief to be alive and a hint of sadness at the meaninglessness of it all.\nMy take away from this was that the great darkness of death is nothing to be feared as I felt like id been there before, almost like an astral womb where we all came from and will return when the time comes."}
{"body":"I’m okay just really tired"}
{"body":"Oh yeah man I've only done it once or twice but it's been a minute.  It's been a long week so I'm excited thanks bro"}
{"body":"My sincere condolences to you and your family."}
{"body":"I abused MDMA when I first found it. Did it. Loved it. So i did it every week (high doses each time and redosing way too much) for like a month. And just in that little time I did some damage. i had a headache for 6 weeks. My BP was insanely high . I was anxious. I felt suicidal. I'm just now , like a year later , feeling \"normal\".\n\nIt's definitely not a forgiving drug because once you take that plunge and over do it.... It's hell!!"}
{"body":"Damn wth only with the weed tho that’s still a lot of brain function I’m slacking"}
{"body":"But then they get the munchies"}
{"body":"Doing your project"}
{"body":"After looking around, it doesn't look like there are laws in the UK restricting timeframe. Even here in the US, the 90 days looks to be more of a strong suggestion. \n\nThe good news is they test for habitual use. Higher concentrations consistently. Your use multiple years ago could show up, but would've likely broken down to be under the threshold for a positive. They allow a small amount to account for second hand intake. \n\nHope this helped in some way. Good luck!"}
{"body":"What’s it like for you? ��"}
{"body":"Sounds like shitty meth yo"}
{"body":"what a waste of space. do you even have any room left for drugs?"}
{"body":"been taking 7-15gs of kratom in tincture form when i have withdrawal and it makes the WDs a little more bearable but it still feels like hell , better than nothing , actually the only thing except opiates that makes the smallest difference in the WD experience, but it does not remove it completely at all not even half of the symptoms... may take you from considering suicide to just in horrible pain"}
{"body":"I smoke nicotine everyday I don’t even count it as a drug to be satisfied with tbh. With or without it. I’m still needing more of something"}
{"body":"Soure?"}
{"body":"I'm sure it is always ideal to keep away from altering your neurological chemistry in any way when you are still developing and probably even after but it's just putting to bed these stupid false accusations that smoking weed at 17 with turn you into a potato. Which apparently it does not aha. \n\nBasically everything you consume other than water and particular food will have a negative impact on you. It's just about managing your personal risk to reward ratio and exercising moderation."}
{"body":"Doesn't seem like a good idea for my addictive personality :P"}
{"body":"I've done acid dozens of times in many doses not once actually seen something that's not there. That's not what hallucinations means. Not all hallucinations have to be visual. I've talked to lots of people who do acid. No one sees shot that isn't there. Stop acting like you know what you're talking about with no experience"}
{"body":"Thank s, oh got it online amazon, the vape that is... And it seems to be doing everything in instructions, except get me high lol.. Or maybe its just different type of high.. I'll keep at it. Thanks again  ��"}
{"body":"Well i can say that when i was walking and not lying in my bed. My chest tightness was still there, but felt better you know. And ye, i didn´t drink magnesium as i am always doing so it should be problem prob. \n\nThanks mate :)"}

{"body":"Please, next time you have a few minutes to spare. May I hear more about the £1 *smell proof tubs?* My imagination was piqued the moment I read your words. I thought for some reason, why don’t I know about those? Oh no, I apologize. I don’t want to come off as an arrogant prick, in shock, of never knowing about those. Honestly, though, now I feel mercurial complaining. Especially after years of many recreational days and nights of different pleasures.   What this amounts to, however, is just trying to find information about those *smell proof tubs.* They sound like possible solutions to, let’s call it, a personal aggravation I have. In rare instances.  Both my  #1  and  #2  are unavailable. Which leaves…amateurs. Granted, this only happens a few times a year, but I can’t stand sloppy pickups, underweight measures, and materials that aren’t freshly cut. Which means no gorgeous, sticky nectar, that adds tasty flavor. \n\n8AB4 507C 9D85 D4D4 33B2 FC1C B681 6D64 82B1 1945"}
{"body":"See I wonder if all these effects are very subtle or obvious. I drink A LOT of coffee and I get these effects but I’m not sure if it’s because of coffee. I don’t notice these effects directly after drinking coffee or anything but I just notice them in everyday life"}

{"body":"i did a few months of microdosing mushrooms. i prefer an lsd microdose for work, but a mushroom md for meditation or writing. i never did more than thrice a week"}
{"body":"I’m curious as to how some of the “less serious” mental issues affect you while taking psychedelics. Things such as anxiety, depression, mood disorders, and personality disorders. I know you can’t participate in clinical trials if you have some (maybe all) of these. Every time I trip, I get insanely anxious, paranoid, and have a bad trip. I just can’t control myself mentally while tripping. I need a benzo or kratom. Makes me think there is some underlying issue there"}
{"body":"True, but what a lot of people fail to recognize, is that when you are in serious or even terminal pain, an oxy or something stronger does not make you feel “high” but rather okay and normal. The pin levels are so intense you don’t enjoy it but you aren’t in agony."}
{"body":"Redoses should be half the original dose. 100mg with a 50mg redose. Eating 1.5-2 hours is better to avoid nausea, an hour is too soon. The melatonin really isn't necessary either"}

I've also experienced some absolutely brilliant and amazing moments while on drugs and also sober. Some things that I have had to realize and practice are self-control, discipline, and abstinence from IV drug use, and my life is much brighter and hopeful now."}
