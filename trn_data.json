Recently a friend of mine was prescribed modafinil and told me it works much better for productivity, lasts longer, and doesn\u2019t have a bad crash. On the down side he said there was little to no euphoria. I was wondering what your guys opinion is on this and which you prefer and why",

        "I made a series of very bad mistakes, and I\u2019m fully aware, but any advice here would mean a lot. Also I guess it would be important to mention I have no past history of anxiety or mental instability.\n\nSo about 4 months back I took some LSD and had a rly bad experience. I basically had a very intense panic attack, where I had severe shortness of breath, and ended up calling the ER. Turns out physically I was completely fine and from that point on, managed to calm myself as was back to normal a few days later.\n\nSkip ahead 2 months, and I\u2019m completely fine, nothings wrong. I start smoking weed again and eventually decide to take shrooms, where I have a milder panic attack. I get it under control and go back home. Next day I was fine, and decided to take 2 weeks of sobriety.\n\nSo by now I\u2019ve decided ok I\u2019m never doing psychedelics again, I can live with it, but I do want to keep smoking weed. And for some reason after smoking at home, I get another (even milder than the shrooms) panic attack, and manage to deal with it in about 15 minutes. \n\nSo I\u2019m like fuck that\u2019s rly bad, I guess I can\u2019t do any drugs anymore. But what\u2019s worse is that the next day, I basically had shortness of breath the entire time. This was 3 days ago, and ever since then, I\u2019ve been in this state. Yesterday I had my first panic attack while completely sober (never had any problems sober before now), and this feeling seems to be governing my life. I\u2019m constantly on edge, and can\u2019t perform everyday activity like work or even eating without getting panicked.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted a psychiatrist but that\u2019s in 10 days. I feel pretty helpless and scared that I\u2019m gonna have this forever. Does anyone else have this sort of drug induced anxiety? Do you guys think this is even anxiety? \n\nSorry for the long read, any advice would be incredibly helpful.",

They are calling me a loser junkie and they actually said they rather see me drink a shit load of alcohol and pass out (what they do every weekend) than smoking weed cause its a DRUG. Its impossible to try to reason with them cause they just start screaming that it's a drug. Good thing im moving away as soon as possible. Btw this is in Scandinavia. Hope we will see some change in the future cause im really hurt mentally rn being called a junkie from my own parents when weed is the only thing stopping me from poppin benzos/oxys which they know nothing about. Life sucks i guess rn hope i will see some positive things soon cause these benzos aint the solution and i just want to smoke my weed after a long day of hard work :/. Sorry just had to get this somewhere out.\n\nForgot to add that i've been heavily addicted to benzos a couple years ago and weed has helped me tremendously not poppin benzos if we dont count the oxys which i do a couple times a month. Now im back on benzos :/",

        "I can\u2019t find much experience reports here so I wanted to know, to those people who use this amphetamine therapeutically and recreationally, how do you feel the \u201chigh\u201d? What is your recreational dose?\n\nI can tell from myself that Vyvanse is very euphoric in higher doses. I need 150-200mg for a recreational effect and 50mg for therapeutic reasons (ADD, impulsive). There is a long lasting amphetamine like euphoria which comes slow and fades away slowly; it\u2019s not an \u201cin your face drug\u201d, effects start after 30 minutes and last up to 12 hours in my experience.\n\nThe side effects are not as bad as those of Ritalin as an example. There is just a very light restlessness sometimes and the hands are cold. The heart rate is just slightly higher as normal. That\u2019s it from my experience. \n\nIt feels like MDMA because the speedy effect is not as strong as normal amphetamine and you feel very empathetic and can control conversations and understand people more. The body load can be described as tingling sensations all around your body. You just want to talk and socialize.\n\nIn therapeutic doses it\u2019s very effective for ADD symptoms, impulsive behavior is reduced and brain fog is gone; the head space is crystal clear.",

        "I have a funny story, and thought I\u2019ll tell you guys. \n\nA couple years ago in college, I decided I wanted to trip but didn\u2019t want the 2-3 hour come up on acid until the peak, so I set an alarm at 6am, dropped a 100ug JOR tab, and set another alarm for 9am. \n\nGreat idea, right? No. I easily fell back asleep, and woke up to the alarm in an extremely confused state and saw my straight edged Marine roommate who had no idea what was going on. I recall him looking like a giant and after a few seconds of intense confusion, I remembered what I did and decided, NOPE. I forced myself to go back to sleep because I didn\u2019t want to navigate getting up and walking past him. Thank god for college sleep deprivation, because I easily fell back asleep and woke up around 4pm feeling almost normal again.\n\nOther than the probably 60 seconds of confusing consciousness, it was intensely uneventful and I had no memorable dreams. None. And I felt much more sober at 4pm than I would have expected 10 hour into a trip. \n\nAll in all, would not do again unless you weren\u2019t living with a straight edged Marine LMFAO",

        "It was my friend Rachels birthday, and with her and another friend, we organised a time where everyone had a full day free so we could trip and hang out together. I\u2019m a student so at the time I was out of my home city living near my university, but I was able to come back to see my friends before my last semester started. I hadn\u2019t seen my friends in a few months because they were busy working most of the time. I arrived at my home city and met with my friend Danny at the train station, after catching up for a bit with him we decided to head to Rachels flat; where we would spend the duration of the trip.\n\nAfter we arrived at the flat, and ate some pizza, we discuss taking acid and how many hits each person wants to take. I had brought 10 tabs of 100ug from a reliable vendor, although they were untested. I wanted to take just 1 tab, I\u2019ve tripped probably 10 times in total, but have never taken more than 2 tabs, and I\u2019ve never really felt the desire to take more than that. My friend Rachel says she\u2019ll take 3, to which Danny says he\u2019ll take 6. I laughed and just assumed Danny was joking,  because while he has around the same experience as me tripping, he\u2019s never taken more than 2/3 tabs, and idk 6 tabs it\u2019s a bit of a jump. We go to the local shop to stock up on drinks and snacks and head back to the flat.\n\nRachels boyfriend was at the flat too, and after he left we decided to dose (he was cool with us all tripping and just wanted Rachel to enjoy time with friends on her birthday). It was around midday now and we all sat on the sofa in the living room and dosed. Immediately after I dosed, I asked \u201cDanny, you really taking 6 tabs?\u201d and he replied, \u201cYeah fuck it why not\u201d, we all just started laughing, however Danny\u2019s laugh seemed a bit more of an anxious laugh now, like he just realised what he did. About 15 minutes later things start getting weird, I didn\u2019t feel anything yet as expected but Danny and Rachel were both talking about coming up already, and Danny started to laugh more anxiously and saying, \u201cAh shit maybe I took too much\u201d, and I sensed some panic in the room.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, they both appear to be tripping quite hard, Rachel decided to go to her bedroom and lay on her bed because her visuals were too intense. I was watching cartoons on the Tv in the living room chilling, slowly beginning to feel the come up, and Danny is talking to Rachel about the visuals he\u2019s seeing. I notice Danny starts to act more panicky, he hasn\u2019t been able to sit down and begins pacing up and down the hallway. I ask him if he\u2019s okay and tell him to try and sit down and calm himself, but he isn\u2019t listening at all. He stops and talks to Rachel for a bit then begins pacing again. At this point I\u2019m starting to trip, and my headspace is getting all fucky.\n\nDanny is still pacing, and it started to freak me out, I kept saying to sit down with me and breathe slowly, but he just kept pacing up and down the hallway. I feel my anxiety kick in and realise this trip is the exact opposite of what I want to be experiencing right now, and from past trips this shit will only get worse. And of course, it did. While Danny is pacing, he half heartedly slaps the door to try and open it when he walks passed it, like he was hitting a fly on the wall. Then he walked passed it again, and I shit you not, looks at me square in the eyes and tells me in an almost demonic tone \u201c**WE ALL NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW**\u201d, then opens the door and SLAMS it shut instantly.\n\nI was very confused and didn\u2019t know *what the fuck* just happened. It then came to me that Danny was not wearing any shoes. He also left his phone at the flat with his wallet and bag.  My friend just left the flat tripping balls, delusional as hell with no shoes on. I couldn\u2019t react because I was tripping quite hard at this point and just assumed (or hoped?) he went out for a cigarette, something he often does while tripping to chill out.\n\nAfter processing that freak out, I shouted to Rachel who was still laying in her bed tripping hard in her own world, oblivious to what just happened. I said \u201cYo Danny just left the flat, with no shoes or phone\u201d. To which he burst out laughing like it was the most hilarious thing she\u2019d heard all year. In my trippy mind I began to laugh too and we both sort of just laughed for about 10 minutes straight, then forgot why we were laughing. I tried to talk to Rachel more, but she had a hard time understanding me. I went back to the living room to watch TV. I didn\u2019t forget about Danny, but I was tripping hard and really didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do. I tried to call him, but of course he left his phone on the table in the living room, and once I realized that I started laughing again, to which created another laughing chain reaction as Rachel hears me laughing again from her bedroom.\n\nAfter about an hour of me watching TV, tripping quite intensely now, Rachel comes to sit next to me, and we attempt to communicate. Rachel was evidently in a different realm to me and describes her visuals as colours melting everywhere. A side note, during this trip I did not have any visuals at all, just the acid headspace, which was very strange. Rachel then gets caught in a thought loop for about an hour, which tripped me out even harder. She thinks I\u2019m Danny and repeats \u201cYou still seeing these visuals Danny\u201d to which I reply, Danny isn\u2019t here and you\u2019re talking to me.\n\nEventually Rachel gets out of the thought loop, she asks me where Danny is, and I tell her again what happened. She was like \u201cwe should probably do something about it. I agree. We think about where he could have gone and eventually conclude he\u2019s either in a bush somewhere tripping nuts, or has decided to go for walk, and will turn up eventually.\n\nAbout an hour later I get a text from this guy who says he works as a security guard at a local hospital saying, \u201cWe have someone here called Danny and he says you\u2019re a friend of his, please come and collect him from x hospital ASAP\u201d. I was so shocked and worried about Danny, I kept reading the text, to ensure my acidy brain wasn\u2019t going schitz. I showed Rachel and that\u2019s when we both kinda freaked out and realised this is a serious situation.\n\nAfter a lot of talk eventually Rachel called her bf and some of our friends and got a taxi to pick up Danny from the hospital. I was waiting in the flat the whole time they were gone, and my mind was trippy and extremely worried and anxious, it was horrible. Eventually they came back, and I watched Danny walk through the door. His face was red and he legit looked like a crack head, super on edge and his clothes were all ripped up and torn. I asked wtf happened and he just said he doesn\u2019t know, then immediately started to argue with me. He kept shouting \u201cwhy the fuck didn\u2019t you stop me\u201d and I just said he was acting delusional and didn\u2019t know wtf to do, it really pissed me off that he blamed me. He stays quiet most of the night after that, but I talk to Rachel and she says he\u2019s fine now.\n\nDays later we find out he jumped out of a window and that\u2019s how he got all the scratches and shit and got taken by police to the hospital. No idea what else he did while he was outside the flat to get nicked, but yeah.\n\nIt was a horrible trip during it I had this very uncomfortable ache/tightness in the very back of my head which didn\u2019t shake for a few days. When Danny came back I felt like I could not communicate at all, like I just couldn\u2019t form any words. I also had a really hard time understanding what people were saying, and if I was supposed to laugh or respond or idk, I couldn\u2019t act human at all.\n\nThe trip kinda ruined acid for me currently, which is sad because I really enjoyed it before this little event. In the end I think Danny is irresponsible for what he did, and the fact he blamed it on me really made me rethink the friendship. Rachel was also pissed too because he didn\u2019t thank her for getting him and could have gotten us in trouble with the law.\n\n**TLDR; Friend took 6 tabs, had a psychotic episode and jumped of a window.**",

I have the feeling I'm not doing enough to get him back on track. He does realize he's been using a lot, but keeps saying it's not gonna be forever. He gets mad when I reach out to him or even say a word about it... Even cooking him meals is too much. To make things even more complex - he became a friend with benefit, but we stopped it recently on mutual terms. Maybe it's not good for him too that I'm around, but I also feel bad no one else is taking care of him.\n\nWhat the f should I do??? How can I be a good friend?",

I know it\u2019s different for everyone so I will take a little less, but if you can give me an idea it would help. I\u2019ve taken seven 325/5 Percocet at one time and I was completely fine so I\u2019m looking for something big that won\u2019t kill me. I thought that the acetaminophen is what would hurt me, but I\u2019ve read it\u2019s 3000-4000 in a day. Still I don\u2019t know how much I can take at once. I can\u2019t do a cold water extract either. So I guess I\u2019m wondering what the max dose is for whichever would cause an overdose first- the oxycodone or the acetaminophen.\n\nI haven\u2019t taken anything in a long time but I do have some experience with opiates",

        "I haven't been well ladies and gentlemen. Valium, Xanax, Etiz, Darvocet, Gabapentin, Alcohol, and worst of all, duster... every single day. I already have depression, anxiety, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, all diagnosed by my PCP and psychiatrist. Aside from the valium and gabapentin, I'm not prescribed any of these drugs. Obviously not duster lmao.\n\nThis is so fucking hard to type, as I'm fucked ass up at 7:30 am. My girlfriend and her mother had an intervention with me yesterday, telling me to get hlp. But I've been there, I've been to psych wards, I've been to rehab, I've been to psychiatrists, I've been to therapists. Nothing has helped. \n\nI don't want to die, I don't want to kill myself, I want to live... but I guess not as everyone else wants me to. Maybe I'll just pack up and leave, maybe I'll try to get clean of the non-prescribed,shit, maybe I'll go to rehab (God please no).\n\nI don't know guys and gals. Drugs used to be a fun little thing to do on my day off, but now it's destroying my life and who I am...\n\nThe worst fucking part is that I dont want to quit, aside from duster. Shit I'm seeing people that aren't even there, shadow people and shit. I've heard stories and thought I'd be scared of them, but it's like \"oh cool...\". \n\nI don't know, at this point it sounds like a full blown psychosis rant, and obviously drugs have made me psychotic if you can't tell. I just need help. Not from a psychiatrist who just types shit on the computer, not from rehab that just teaches me about 12 steps to make me believe in God, not from a psych ward that just gives me more drugs that make me sleep, not from a therapist that just asks me question after question.\n\nWHAT DO I DO r/Drugs?! I honestly just want to vagabond and \"soul search\" or some other *hippie* shit. \n\nSorry guys, I just needed to rant. I love you all and hope you are all safe and feel okay. &lt;3",

        "Those of you who read my previous post will know I'm currently in recovery from a 15 year heroin and crack addiction.  It's going pretty well (in part thanks to the support I've received on here) Well last night I was pretty tired, you know the kind of tired where you can't think properly and are just going on auto-pilot.  I got paid today and previously the rest of my week is just me looking forward to me getting paid (strangely every job as well as when I received benefit money has always paid me on a Friday) so its been a sort of habit for me to walk to the cashpoint Thursday night at midnight, as that was one of the only times I wouldn't have to worry about how I would get the money to score.   Well last night without really thinking about it, at midnight I went out and walked to the cash point a short walk from my house!! Don't worry guys I didn't score, when I 'came to my senses' I went to Curry house and got myself an awesome beef curry!! It's weird what you do when you get into a habit of something, I'm totally confident that I'll never do something similar and get into a situation where I'll be around drugs, I just thought it's interesting how after doing something 'religiously' for 15 years, even when it's unnecessary you can do it on autopilot",

        "First off, anyone who\u2019s considering taking psychedelics, know why you want to do it. Introspection? Cool. Healing? Definitely possible. Recreation? Well alright, but that\u2019s not always what you\u2019ll get, as I experienced last night. I was semi nervous going into this because I had only gone as far as 2 tabs. But I\u2019m glad I took 3. But because I went in with this uncertainty, I tried to trick myself kinda, so I just said \u201calright I\u2019m going to just have an awesome time and not care about going deep into my mind. I\u2019ll watch videos and have cool visuals and feel good.\u201d \n\nAnd while all of those things happened, minus watching videos pretty much since I could hardly operate technology, what I received was much different than what I expected.\n\nExpectations, might as well just siphon out all your gasoline from your cars and light em on fire because expectations go right out the window.\n\nI learned how to let go.\n\nI learned how to float.\n\nHere it is.\n\n////////\n\nTook 3 tabs of acid last night. Anyone else get that weird jaw clenching feeling? Like they wanna clench their jaw cause your face feels weird?\n\nAnyways I tripped absolute b\u00e6lls\u00e6ck last night. I spent the comeup attempting to be sexual but I had nausea and it got to the point where I just couldn\u2019t anymore. Such a weird feeling. So I went to my bed and laid down listening to some music, Pink Floyd, whatever I could manage to fumble on through my iPad which made NO sense.\n\nAlso, the lyrics to comfortably numb finally make sense. Every line every word. Especially \u201cyou would not understand, this is not how I am\u201d because I was trying to text my friend what I was experiencing but words are so bad at communicating psychedelia. \n\nThen come peak time around 6am, it starts getting light outside and I can see the blue and purple sky through my window. So I decide to go on a walk. Was kinda weird interacting with my dad but eventually I got out the door and just started walking down the street as the sun starts coming up on the nicest Saturday morning, as I\u2019m beginning to peak on 300 mics. Not much better feeling I\u2019ll tell you that right now.\n\nThe fucking trees. The HD. Everything.\n\nEverywhere I walked, sprinklers would start turning on. As if I was controlling them by merely being in their presence. The way the sunrise started coming over the trees which by the way looked so pastel/cartoony yet hyper HD all at once. I remember saying to myself and my audio recordings \u201cthe replications are all so spot on\u201d \u2014&gt; r/replications give it a visit if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nThere was water on the side of the road and the reflections were so HD. \n\nHow can life be so much more HD and awe beholding than real life perception itself?\n\nSo I continue to come to my peak, and I come to a point in the street where there\u2019s a community entrance to the forest by my house. I\u2019m feeling adventurous so why not. I walk into this tunnel of trees into darkness, and I wanted to stop to pee but every step into the woods was a whole new sight to behold and look at. I just stared up through the canopy of hyper realistic leaves and slight geometry (had some tolerance) and seeing water on the leaves. It was honestly incredible, and none of my other trips were even close to that beauty. I can only begin to imagine what is at higher doses than 300. \n\nI\u2019d like to think I have a pretty grounded sense of self. I knew I could\u2019ve gone deeper. And I will one day. But for now I can only speculate as to where my mind can go. \n\nInterested in trying shrooms and comparing the effects.\n\nAlso this was my only trip out of 5-6 ish that had any healing, medicinal, introspection and powerful feelings to such a degree. I felt like I finally got the cobwebs shaken loose as they say around here sometimes. Like it reset my brain as I\u2019ve read. The weirdest part is I don\u2019t even know what it did but I just know it did something. Something good.\n\nSomething that will allow me to enjoy life the way I think we all have a chance to.\n\nPeace guys.",

I may have missed a night here or there but it was pretty much every night. \n\nLong story short, I stopped cold turkey and started getting horrible withdrawal symptoms. Chills, insomnia, diarrhea, electric feeling under skin, brain zaps and terrible rebound anxiety.\n\nMy doctor didn\u2019t seem too concerned and said she would be very surprised if I became addicted to such a low dose. She even gave me a prescription of Klonopin and told me to not take it every night. \n\nI took 0.25mg yesterday after having a panic attack. Before that it was about 5 or 6 days before I took any and today I haven\u2019t taken any. \n\nOddly enough, today I feel fine. \n\nSo my question is: is it possible or even worth it to taper off this amount or should I just bite the bullet and sweat it out? \n\nI\u2019m gonna see how i feel tomorrow. Hopefully whatever was happening has passed but if not might try the taper.\n\nAny advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated.",

        "Short Story from last night actually I just wanted to share and get some feedback on . I was At a Club in Manhattan and was drinking like a maniac when my friend pulls out  a bag of blow ! In the middle of the crowd he gets a key bump and just brings it up to my nose and I said fuck it and decided to sniff it. About 5 minutes later I felt the drip in my throat , and I felt\nGood but I didn\u2019t feel anything other than just a little sobered up , I proceeded to do about 6 - 7 more bumps probably and just was chilling drinking more beers and shots . \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t feel it that much they said I did a lot for my first time ! \nIs that how it\u2019s supposed to feel ? Or because I was drinking a lot it just straightened me out a little ?",

        "Now I'm wondering: is it because I probably have an addictive personality (although my DOC is definitely alcohol and I do my best to stay away from it, it doesn't always work though and I drink heavily at least two times a month, so I still consider myself an alcoholic like. My father and my sister are alcoholics, but they are functional so they don't think that's a problem. And that's how I know it's probably genetic.) that I don't allow myself to feel pleasure?\nI was feeling good with Vyvanse (not only like \"adhd free good\", but \"euphoric good\" too) but not abusing it (if \"taking as prescribed\" = not abusing). Anyway, it just didn't feel right for me to feel like this everyday (also, I was taking breaks 2 days a week and the comedown felt awful), or am I right to think this stuff is dangerous?\n\nThe reason for switching from ritalin to vyvanse in the first place was duration of effects. Vyvanse was not that long lasting either, and as he upped the dose it just felt even stronger instead of longer lasting. \n\nSo, I'm back to good old ritalin who doesn't work that well but I feel it's much less harmful to my body (I can take breaks from it and my symptoms just come back, I don't feel a comedown like I did with Vyvanse, for instance).\n\nWe don't have amphetamines in Brazil except for Vyvanse. The only other options of stimulants are Methylphenidate (and all its prolonged and super prolonged release brands) and Modafinil. \n\nI tried mdma once and I would say it was really close to Vyvanse 70 mg (never did meth to compare, it doesn't arrive here afaik).\n\nForgot to mention: ever since I started treating adhd, this doctor has been pushing Vyvanse to me (because that's what worked best for his patients) but I always denied because it's extremely expensive.",

        "This happened about a month ago with one of my plugs that I\u2019d been buying from for a couple years so we\u2019d developed a sort of friendship over this time. He was always on time, had great supply that he would test and weigh in front of us because he seemed to actually care about us just having a good time. He even brought us lemon juice when we bought an eighth of shrooms so we could lemon tek and \u201cget more out of the experience\u201d. \n\nA few months before he killed himself he and his best friend (who also sells) got pulled over by state patrol while moving supply across state. At the time he had Lsd, shrooms, MDMA, copious amounts of weed, as well as varying kinds of benzos and opiates in his car. He posted on his story that he was facing 7 felonies and that we wouldn\u2019t be hearing from him for awhile.\n\nWell the next day he posts in full confidence \u201cYour boi got off, not a single felony just a few misdemeanors\u201d. Now me and my friends have no knowledge on how the legal system works but the fact they dropped \u201c7 felonies\u201d seemed crazy to us at the time. His best friend that was with him posted videos of him roaming the streets with one flip flop on asking people to cash app him money so he could get an uber to his grandmas. I had guessed that they had a falling out throughout the whole situation.\n\nA few days later my old plug said on his story he was gonna pull up on his \u201cbest friend\u201d and beat his ass. So obviously they were no longer the great friends that they were a week ago. I still don\u2019t really understand the whole situation and how it played out that way so if any of you guys have any clue on how the legal system works I\u2019d appreciate your input.\n\nAbout a week later he makes his usual post on his story about what he has in stock. I\u2019m with my friend who\u2019s having his house warming party that weekend so he hits him up and asks if he could meet up tonight. The plug says \u201cI can meet up around 12 but I\u2019m killing myself tonight so I won\u2019t be available\u201d. Me and my friend thought he was just joking because that\u2019s the kind of humor he\u2019s always had so we didn\u2019t suspect anything but we ended up not buying from him that day because someone else was able to meet at a more convenient time.\n\nAt around 10PM he posts \u201cwhos got xans and percs\u201d on his story. We didn\u2019t connect the dots, we just assumed he was restocking his supply only to find out that he had apparently overdosed that night. It\u2019s not like we were that close but it\u2019s just weird having that happen to someone you knew relatively well and interacted with on a regular basis. I guess I just made this post to get the whole situation \u201con paper\u201d and I guess reminisce about a relatively decent guy who cared about the people he sold to.",

But I genuinely have had dreams about green and ecstasy, both times getting a weird kind of fuzzy body high. \n\nDream #1 \n\nWalking through my local town, I\u2019m smoking cigarettes with one of my friends and we get stopped by this guy in the middle of the street, he asks for a lighter. I hand him my lighter and he starts sparking a joint, I instantly begin to smell it and I swear to god I genuinely got high, like i\u2019m not even joking. I was laying down and felt stoned as fuck.\n\nDream #2 \n\nI\u2019m at a festival with my friend, same friend as Dream #1, and they\u2019re all taking ecstasy, so I just decide to take a pill and instantly I feel high, but it\u2019s exactly the same high as the one from Dream #1.\n\nThe high doesn\u2019t correlate with the usual high from the drug. It\u2019s basically like a fuzzy feeling throughout my whole body. It\u2019s not exactly pleasurable, just really fucking weird.\n\nHas anyone else ever experienced anything like this.",

Specifically I have been using 3-HO-PCP and experiencing these effects, but have had similar experiences with a ton of other dissos.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knows if using these substances puts you in need of certain supplements, or if it should be advised to take something in the name of harm reduction to reduce damage. I'm thinking along the lines of pre/post loading before and after MDMA, and taking vitamin B12 after nitrous oxide usage.",

        "Hey there! \n\nSo About a week ago I took mdma at a festival just like any other time. It was the 4th time during the last 2 months so first off, I think it was too frequent (never had more than a single pill) and I regret that. Had no real comedown afterward (no comedown the other times as well) then a few days ago I started doing little panic attacks, feeling anxious, vision feels kinda strange (not that much), been shaking a bit and feeling weak, also had diarrhea but looks like its doing better now. The thing is it looks like it's mostly happening the evening, during the afternoon I would feel normal even happy that I'm not feeling bad. I'm feeling pretty bad about it, went to the hospital yesterday and gave me Xanax 0.25, I have not taken it cause I'm not sure I really do need it (I'm abit afraid of that with all I heard about .\n\nShould I be concerned? As of now I fear I might always feel like this but I obviously can't think straight. Any ideas? \n\nThanks!",

        "So before I get into anything else this isn't a question about an addiction forming. In fact I'm pretty sure it has already begun. I'm aware of how addiction manifests itself and how sneaky it can be so this isn't a question of \"is my roommate addicted to coke?\"\n\nOver the last 10 days he has certainly used every single day. We've seen him, he doesn't hide it. He'll rail a line every now and then while he's gaming/on his computer in the living room. \n\nThe problem is, we don't know how much he has bought. We know he bought an 8ball about 10 days ago but it's almost impossible that he hasn't gone through more than that since it has also been shared.\n\nSo let's say this then. How much of a physical health problem would it be to effectively have gone through 5ish grams of coke (assuming he has bought two 8balls and includes sharing) in approximately 10 days?\n\nLikely addiction forming aside, how worrisome should this be from a physical health standpoint? I am a very casual user of coke who doses responsibly and have never been around somebody who has done too much, so that's why I'm asking here.\n\n**Edit**: It should also be noted that I'm pretty sure he has taken some amount of modafinil at least some of the days (though I expect every day) along with it. Not sure if this matters or not but worth including.",

I felt the need to draw so I grabbed a joker playing card and blacked the face out and drew peace signs and wrote love. Then I went back up the stairs and laid in bed looking at the ceiling. I saw abstract faces popping out at me from all angles. I saw that in the bathroom too. \n\nThen I remembered  that I had a juice downstairs. I had 2 glasses that I forgot about. I went back to my room and feelings  was just moving in and out around me. I grabbed a book and started to read but then I realized I could read with my eyes closed. Words would just appear. I also had moments where I felt I was falling through the air but I was in bed. \n\nI don't remember much else. I do remember having a really weird feeling that I shouldn't do that again though, even though I really enjoyed it. I feel like I met a shroom spirit or something who told me that.

I guess they are both pro-drugs which breakdown to Diazepam and Alprazolam, so taking enough should get you the same satisfaction. \n\nI can't find anything that states their illegality. They are seperate compounds that are not even scheduled, and the analogue act only applies to analogue chemicals of schedule I and II substances. \n\nBecause these analogues aren't illegal in the US (except a few state bans on certain compounds), I am shocked how difficult it is to find these drugs on legit online retailers. I Have spent hours looking into how to get stuff that is 100% legal in most of the world, as well as my country and state but the legal online market appears to be only scams.",

        "So, as the title states, I want to find out a bit more about the long term effects of both MDMA and ketamine.\n\n I am currently what I would call a \"regular\" user. In most months I will go through maybe 0.7G of MDMA and 0.5G of Ketamine at the very most. I don't drink more than the average person and I also smoke maybe 2-3G of weed per week, although I have been smoking less\n\nNearly every study I have looked at doesn't really define what sort of usage they are examining, and some that prove changes in serotonin levels etc gave animals 4-8 doses of MDMA in the space of 5 days. I personally think that is an absolutely ridiculous amount to test with, as no normal user is going to be doing it that often.\n\nSo, what are the short/long term effects of both ketamine and MDMA on the average user? Apart from the usual comedown, sore jaw etc? Thanks.",

We got scared shitlessly because he was showing no signs of life except breathing and being tense in muscles, like he was laid back on a chair, we tried to move him around, but his body was stiff and resistant.\n\n\nThen suddenly, like 5 minutes later, he wakes up like nothing happened and just describes it as he has \"lost control\". \n\nNow im not sure what exactly he meant by that, because ive never experienced something like this, but i was talking to some other friends later and they had said that they also experienced smth like that. They described it as something similar to when u wake up and cant move. But thats not good for me either since ive also never experienced that.\n\nCan someone describe in more detail how does \"loosing control\" feel like? And is it dangerous?",

        "2 years ago I occasionally smoked weed and got high, europhoric and creative sort of every time. Gradually and naturally, I built up a tolerance to the point that I don't enjoy weed at all anymore.\nFast forward to today and I can smoke 2-3 joints and feel nothing but nicotine kick and sort of a dull headache that lasts 15 minutes and then I am completely sober.\n\nNow, here is the problem. I have taken big breaks, ranging from a week to 3+ months.\nWhen I smoke after 3 months, the first 3-4 joins are feeling great, but the diminishing return on the rest is just through the roof. The next day, it is as if the tolerance is back to maximum level, I will light up a few joins and feel like in a prolonged nicotine state.\n\nNow, is this phenomenon reversable or will my tolerance always reach maximum peaks after 1-2 days of smoking.\nMy other theory is that Swedish weed have become watered down and less potent the last years.",

Firstly I took half a pill of 2c-b and had severla tokes of a joint shortly afterwards, I also took a tiny bit of dxm, 200-250mg I would estimate, only enough to normally put me on a low first plat with my tolerance.  It started off with me feeling slightly stoned after smoking, then however I noticed a different feeling emerging, it was hard to explain, it felt very clear headed but like I was focused in to every part of every moment, this didn\u2019t allow me to think ahead too much. There was somewhat of a body load and I had quite bad munchies, all of my senses were heightened, colours were brighter but no open eye visuals. However at one time I chose to close my eyes and I saw lots of shapes and eyes but not that clearly. My friends were behaving quite goofy and talking a lot but I didn\u2019t really partake in conversation. I decided to lay down with music and close my eyes, I listened to my normal rap then put on binaural beats. I wanted to see how far this drug would take me, unfortunately it didn\u2019t go too far beyond CEVS. I was very self reserved the whole time, I felt like I didn\u2019t want to waste this drug experience by socialising, instead getting the most out of the drug and exploring the headspace. Overall it was interesting and I\u2019m eager to try it again, however I would prefer to try it in the comfort of my home, and a whole pill on its own instead of what I took today. I feel like psychedelics will be a very personal experience to me rather than social or bonding in the future.\n\nEDIT: I am still feeling the effects of this and I am on the comedown, I feel fairly relaxed but tired. I don\u2019t feel like my mood is low or anything.",

I was having some trouble at home and I wanted to go out as soon as I woke up, so he called me and he said that he got a \u201csurprise\u201d that I\u2019ll really like, anyways I went to his house and we stayed at his room, then he got me a white/yellowish powder that he claimed it was cocaine (I\u2019ve always told him that I want to try cocaine). I sniffed it and god, it was the best thing ever, I really liked it and he said he could get us more from his friend if I got some cash on me and I told him that I\u2019d get some money to do some more that night. Luckily, another friend of mine ,who was an ex heroine addict, told me that it wasn\u2019t cocaine, it was \u201cBesa\u201d ( a local and very cheap drug in egypt which contains a mix of cheap heroine and morphine). If I didn\u2019t talk to that friend that day, I would\u2019ve done more and more and god knows what would\u2019ve happened. Trust no one, I really can\u2019t believe after all what i\u2019ve done to him and all the things we\u2019ve been through, he tricked me into doing heroine just so I could be an addict just like him and do that shitty drug from my money.",

All of our dealers are at a festival right now and the only thing we could sort was 5g of some real good weed. To my surprise, it was a great night. We all got pretty stoned from plenty of fat bong rips and a few spliffs; it just took me back to the old days. We ordered food and played Minecraft split screen for hours, it was so wholesome and I felt so in control. \n\nReally refreshing, definitely going to cut back on harder drugs and relax more, I just feel so much more alive and normal this morning.",

I\u2019ve tripped once before, I did 150ug and went out to a very public area at around hour 5 and it was a little bit overwhelming but nothing I couldn\u2019t handle. We also went to a restaurant at around hour 6-7 and I could act relatively normal. Since I\u2019m not gonna have to face anyone until hour 8, I\u2019m thinking that since the peak would have worn off by then I should be fine, but I don\u2019t really have a good indication of how long the trip will last since last time I smoked a fuck ton of weed on it towards the end. \n\nSo tl;dr: dropping 140ug of acid at 12pm today, will I be fine to face my parents by 8pm tonight?\n\n\nUpdate: I did it! It was an adventure and I almost wigged out a few times but I managed to talk to my entire family and sit at dinner for like 3 hours on fucking lsd. So yay me!",

        "I been smoking since I was 13. I didn\u2019t have the best childhood and I basically smoked through my teenage years going through an ounce a week usually, being stoned off my ass 24/7. I\u2019m 17 now and about a month ago I went into foster care. When I was taken in I didn\u2019t bring any weed with me because I thought I could give it up. but after ONE DAY without it, the next morning I woke up puking with horrible stomachs cramps and later on I got headaches. \n\n     So thinking it would make me feel better I scored some bud and the moment I smoked it I felt normal again and had my first meal all day. The next day I tried to go without weed, same thing happened. So I bought a dab pen since I could discreetly smoke without my foster family knowing but i don\u2019t want to rely on this drug to feel normal. It\u2019s almost like the time when I was withdrawing from OxyContin but not as extreme.",

I smoke weed almost every day, drink occasionally, recently tried adderall, and vyvanse, but that\u2019s about it. Never tripped before. I\u2019m not sure what the dosage for these tabs are, but I\u2019ll ask my guy. \n\nI\u2019m basically just going to list some random questions below and if you have any advice or any answers I\u2019d love to hear them!\n\n- Will I get nauseous, and if so, how do I avoid the nausea? \n- Should I wait to smoke weed until the acid kicks in? \n- Any recommendations for things to do while on acid? \n- I have anxiety and depression, but it\u2019s not bad every day. I believe I\u2019m mentally  strong enough to handle a bad trip. Do you think this anxiety and depression may cause me to have a bad trip though? \n\nIf you want to add anything other tips or information just go for it!",

        "Hi guys! So next week I am planning to try out LSD for my first time. \nFor the record, I smoke weed daily for about 3 years now, and I have some experience with psychedelics - I was on shroom 3 times and have a blast every time, which is also a reason I wanna go one step higher. My setting is really good, safe and calm, so is my mindset.\nSo my questions are: How much to take for the first time to have a descent lsd experience, but not too intense? What are the thing to do on lsd? How to get throught a bed trip in case i get there? Does sugar break down the effect like it does when on shrooms?\nI would found any piece of advice from someone who had an lsd experience very useful.",

        "Last night when smoking a blunt with a few friends and I threw up while we were smoking because i felt so nauseous. My friends were complaining that the blunt tasted like shit but I chalked it up to the wraps being super cheap. I kept the 1/4 of the blunt that was left and went to smoke it tonight by myself and after a few hits I was ready to vomit again. I think maybe I just got like a void and was only hitting shitty wrap but even the smoke was making me gag. I didnt get enough to get high unfortunately but my only option other then these shitty wraps is to smoke out of an Arizona can and that doesnt sounds all too great. Any help is appreciated.",

This is a post on my own experience and how easily your mindset changes before and after drugs. This is my own introspective experience and won\u2019t be this same with everyone. Enjoy \n\nI was 16, going to my first party. Prior the party I haven\u2019t touched any substances, that wasn\u2019t really common in my year, and I tried to promise myself that I won\u2019t touch anything until I\u2019m 18. There were many times where I was asked to try molly, to try LSD, and to of course drink alcohol. When this night came I no longer wanted to feel like that outcast who hasn\u2019t had alcohol. Myself as a person I haven\u2019t been the most confident, I was always that shy boy. But after I had a few drinks, I started to feel so confident and not giving a care in the world with what I did. I was jumping off roofs into the pool, hooking up with chicks who I never had the guts to even talk to, so many things happened in that night where I would not of even thought to feel comfortable for myself to do, I fell in love with alcohol. I started to drink every weekend for like 6 months with having a few week breaks through the 6 month period. My tolerance started to build up and it started to get expensive to get to the drunk state where I loved. So I started to not drink as often.\n\nI convinced myself that alcohol reached to a point where I\u2019m used to the effects and didn\u2019t find that enjoyment I used to have off it but I continued to keep drinking to fit in with my social groups. Months passed and I started to meet this girl, at first I didn\u2019t think much of it, she seemed to have a big interest in me always wanting to hang out so I didn\u2019t deny her, I went along with it, she seemed really cool and I began to feel really comfortable around her, so comfortable, the most comfortable around anyone I know. I knew she was worth a shot, but didn\u2019t want to rush into anything. She moved to my town which was about an hour away and she was familiar with drugs and just partying but never tried it herself but really wanted to, me being really invested into her I wanted to try drugs too then, without any persuasion I was buying myself 2 points of pure molly. My friend told me to try nitrous with molly, prior this I have tried nitrous and I also loved it but didn\u2019t really put it in the drug category that molly is in. I had ten bulbs and 2 points of molly that night. Before I dunked the first capsule of molly, I was shaking and panicking so much that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable but, I used the nitrous to get my mind off it. An hour passed and it kicked in. Never in my life have I felt so happy and confident in myself, I didn\u2019t overthink of things to say or do. I fell in love once again to another substance.\n\nI tried to convince myself to keep that 3 month break for molly, but I was too in love. I did it every week for about 3 months. I didn\u2019t want to lose that confidence at parties. My bond with that girl got stronger and stronger and I started to keep using the molly to try and get closer and closer with her, it worked but then I hit a massive slump from her not feeling the same towards me anymore. This changed my entire life. I never have felt so happy and comfortable with someone ever. I couldn\u2019t cope. We continued to be friends but I was still so emotionally invested in her and continued to take molly but not as frequently just to feel that confidence towards her. The reality of her not liking me always drove my comedowns off molly so terrible. I started become to rude towards her and calling her names and not accepting her moving on. It drove me into a terrible person and she hated it.\n\nI stopped molly for awhile but still was so involve with escaping reality, I didn\u2019t care about myself . I started to get back to drinking and to take nitrous, my nitrous use got intense every night out I inhaled about 30-50 bulbs with about 15-25 standard drinks. It got intense. This drove me not giving a shit about a single thing. My grades starting to sky fall, the income going to zero and my friends slowly going away, I only had junky friends who til this day aren\u2019t my true friends.\n\nI woke up one day and just wanted to change things up, so I bought my first psychedelic, shrooms. I bought two grams of it. It was a fun experience but didn\u2019t feel like I got any benefits out of this drug as I did with molly. Months later I tried LSD, no benefits. I couldn\u2019t find the escape and or confidence. So Xanax came along, I tried it and passed the fuck out. But the next day was beautiful, the afterglow made me so anxious free and not giving any care in the world, looking back at it, it\u2019s scary how I felt like that. I continued this Xanax phase for about 4 days taking up to 6mg every night. After third night I mixed it with weed. The next day was pure sadness. I felt so guilty and couldn\u2019t talk or socialise with anyone at school. This constant sadness and disappointment with myself went on for months. \n\nI was nearly 18 with no car or job or many close friends and my headspace was so dark. So many intrusive thoughts went through my head. No motivation to change. The only positive is that I stopped drugs for a while besides alcohol and nicotine and occasionally weed. I turned 18 and I was clean for a few months from everything besides the drugs I mentioned, so I decided to try molly once again. It was the worst experience ever. My anxiety drove through the roof and at the party I was at I just wanted to punch everyone in sight especially the girl who I liked so much, but I just sat there rolling so hard not talking to anyone, fucked out of my mind just smoking cigarettes.\n\nThe next day I told myself no more drugs Oliver it\u2019s ruining you. About three months passed and I started to get a new car, closer to my friends again and getting a new job, until one night came. I saw on Snapchat that some really strong alprazolam pills were in from my mate, first thing I did is message my mate and he was keen for it, at the time being I was really happy and proud of myself with where I was but I just wanted to have some fun, didn\u2019t think any bad from it. I took three... 2 days I\u2019ll never get back, I don\u2019t remember the full two days. All I remember is rocking up to some house stealing my friends nitrous and me driving home in my car with my mum crying in the lounge room. My mental state slumped to the lowest ever. I genuinely thought I needed professional help. I talked about it to a couple of my close mates and even some ex friends messaged me seeing if I was okay. But days after the incident my mental state got better I picked myself up and started to fix my life once again. I started to open up more to my friends, I started to find new jobs. I was truly working myself back up.\n\n1 month has passed from that incident and I have never been happier with my life. I have promised myself I won\u2019t touch any substances again besides low doses of nitrous and alcohol, but not as frequent as it was. Nothing so called \u201chard\u201d drugs I will try again.\n\nMoral of all this is that the people around you influence the way you think and become. Before I met that girl I was so anti drugs with my past dealing with drug related problems with my family and close people in my life. Be very careful who you are around and the actions you take, one night could lead into a disaster and regret. I\u2019m only 18 and didn\u2019t want to choose my life to be so invested in drugs. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if taken safely drugs can just be a fun experience but I hope my story will lead people into intelligent choices. Don\u2019t let drugs control you, take wisely or not at all, stay safe.",

So i poured some warm acetone on it and then evapped that to kind of save whatever i could.... and it was almost down to maybe half a shot glass when i brain farted and dipped my pinky in it and tasted it... FORGETTING THAT IT WAS ACETONE. I rinsed my mouth and spit like 10 times... And like a half hour later i started getting very strong wierd head rushy / fuzzy little zaps in my brain for a second or too.. is this okay? Is it dope? Ive never felt this way on it before.. is it the acetone? How harmful is a pinky dip of acetone? Im a little anxious in all honesty...\n\n\nEdit: sorry guys my anxiety got the best of me i apologize",

I can think more clearly on alchohol and feel like I don't fuck myself up as bad because I can tell the amount to drink. With weed I'll do more then I should and end up wanting to die. The only thing weed has over alchohol is the next day after weed is nice, next day after alchohol ends up being a \"eat something and you'll puke\" situation.

        "So the first time this happened to me it was a couple of years ago, i was smoking about 8 grams out of a pipe with my friend over the course of an hour or two. He dared me to take as big a hit as i could, and i did, and i threw up. at the time i was smoking daily. after that, i was doing acid a few months later and was also smoking and just smoked a blunt, no hard hits or anything just regular, and i got dizzy, nauseous, sweaty and ended up throwing up (didn\u2019t end up ruin my trip btw, had a great time the minute after i threw up). i was smoking daily then as well . since then, every couple times at least that i smoke (not soon after the last time it happened during acid, i cut down my marijuana use to a handful of times a month for unrelated reasons) i throw up at least once, a time or two i threw up like 5 times.  and the last 4 ish months i\u2019ve cut to smoking only once or twice a month also for unrelated reasons. also it doesn\u2019t happen every single time i smoke, but when it does happen it\u2019s not the full blown attacks you read about when you search CHS that last hours to days to weeks to months. it\u2019s at the most 10 mins. after that i\u2019m completely fine. So is it CHS? if so, what can i do to combat CHS? i really don\u2019t want to give up cannabis. \n\nAlso, can anyone give me some insight on who CHS is caused. i understand it\u2019s by long term heavy use, but why does it only happen to some? is it something to do with the cannabinoid receptors and the levels ? how does it work (if that\u2019s even known information?)\n\nPlease don\u2019t tell me to \u201cgoogle it lazy ass\u201d because i did and all i got was bullshit from rehab centers. i wouldn\u2019t have made this long ass post if i could\u2019ve just googled it.",

        "My nostrils only consume ketamine once every couple of months with the intention and dosage to hole. From everything I\u2019ve read and from the experiences of friends, a hole is typically around 40 minutes to an hour.\u00a0\n\nDuring my first experience I was out for around 45-50 minutes. The second time it was very different and I just broke out of it after only about 20 minutes. The time after that was similar and seemed like it wasn\u2019t just that the anesthetic effects were short, but almost as if I was just pulled out of it and it was *cut* short.\u00a0\n\nMy tolerance has been unaffected since I\u2019ve only holed about 4 times and they were spaced out in between a couple of months. Should I try a higher dose?\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m just kinda frustrated. I really love the K-Hole and I make it a special rare occasion thing so it doesn\u2019t lose the magic. It\u2019s annoying to just be unexpectedly pulled out of total cosmic bliss and unity, immersed in the experience and then all of the sudden I\u2019m back in my room after only 20 minutes feeling evicted from the void.

I even drank lean during those 4 years, it was bad. But one time during my sophomore year it was late start at school (school started at  8, late starts at 10:35) I usually went to this park right next to the school I went to, and I smoked like one gram and I was a lightweight so I was pretty high, I then walked to school and went and got breakfast and sat down with my friends, my friend offered me an Ambien and it was a small pill so I underestimated it, I remember blacking out, waking up in my 2nd period, and then ending up in my 4th period being afraid of my classmates sitting next to me. It was all in front of my math teacher because my desk was literally in front of his board. It all ended during lunch the next period. fast forward a couple years, friend tells me it wasn't ambien and that it was oxy. \n\nTl:Dr: I smoked before school, friend offered me a pill when i was high af, took it, got fucked up, lol",

My friend just told me to take it for a high) and I took percs with 6 total mg of xans (I was really sad and had a benzo tolerance, it took 8 mg for a high) one time, both of those times I have NO idea what mg they were.  This time I'm sad and have one 7.5 mg Vicodin and I didn't know if its dangerous or if it's too little.  I have no tolerance to opoids.  My first time was September(?) And second time was March.  Please give me advice on this stuff as I've mostly only done benzos after lots of googling lol and I tried with Vicodin and can't find much",

        "**(Also posted on** r/kratom **but wanted to share my 1st experience w/ this wonderful substance with everyone here as well).**\n\n**First timer here. Took 4 grams of Red Bali that my mother gave me (she's been using it for awhile now and swears by it... I've always been reluctant).**\n\nI apologize if this post is too long or lackluster, but I just really feel like expressing how wonderful this is:\n\nI've been/ *AM* addicted to adderall, have been for slightly over a year now. Along with that, I've been habitually using oxycodone &amp; hydrocodone.. and even hydromorphone since this summer. There is something about the relief and sedation that is just pure bliss. I must say, I have always been ***terrified*** of what painkillers/narcotics do to people and that is the exact reason I'm sitting here typing this.\n\nAfter repeatedly upping my dose of oxycodone last week I decided it was time to have some self-discipline and stay away from it, but WOW, the cravings have been intense. The majority of my day was/is centered on getting that fix, that sweet release.\n\nCame home today to get that fix and decided I'd ask my mother for some kratom instead as I imagined it had similar effects with less downfalls. Let me just say - I've done all 3 of the narcotics listed above, at extremely high doses, and they are NOTHING compared to kratom. If you have tried the harder narcotics, especially IV hydromorphone (which I'm sure a few of you have) *then you're aware of that pure bliss, nothing matters, life is fucking beautiful* feeling. With Kratom, I'm not exactly experiencing that, but why should I? Life isn't perfect and we're not meant to feel amazing 24/7. In fact, for once in what feels like forever, I have absolutely no desire at all to touch any other substance.\n\nAnyways, I want to just wrap this up and say that I am extremely grateful for this plant. I'm realizing the importance of gratitude as a side note; with other substances this hasn't been present. ALSO: I apologize if I sound out of my mind, etc. but I know/understand that kratom still has dangerous properties when not used right; I truthfully don't see myself abusing this as my mom (bless her) is going to guide me through it and moderate things.\n\nI feel like there is ***SO*** much more I could write about, (which I plan to, but in my notebook where I describe my substance experiences for personal reference) but I think I got my point across.\n\n**TL;DR: Coming from a multi-substance addict... Kratom is AMAZING.**\n\n**EDIT: (QUESTION) - why are we not prescribing this for certain mental health AND physical conditions as opposed to synthetic stuff?? It's mildly dispirting that we aren't recognizing the value of something the Earth naturally provides..**",

        "If you want to get fucked up there are much more enjoyable substances out there that will cause nowhere near as much damage as benzos do. \n\nAnd before you tell me that they are meant for people with anxiety. This whole post is coming from a person with legitimate anxiety - I can assure you that you will get addicted to this substance no matter what.\n\nI was abusing xanax, klonopin as well as clonazolam in the later stages recreationally for a total period of 6 months. On average I'd say I took benzos three days a week but given the stupid high doses I took during the semi-blackout phases and the fact that benzos half-life is absolutly nuts I was probably high 24/7. The memories of me using for the most part are very vague\n\nUpon cessation I felt the withdrawal literally for 2 years straight\n\nThe withdrawal symptoms leave you feeling brain damaged - constantly feeling dizzy and not being able to focus on anything. Your intestines barely work, you cannot digest most food for months with no end in sight. Any type of GABA agonist causes those symptoms to spike. There was a time where while being 6 months sober I had a week long horror spike because I took a multivitamin with Magnesium which turned out to be a GABA agonist. That's how absurd benzo damage is - even certain herbs and foods tend to cause spikes leaving your symptoms at a baseline.\n\nAt the end of the day the \"high\" if you can call it like that is not worth it. It mostly comes down to not feeling or remembering anything which seems lame and indeed it is but somehow you are becoming addicted to it. Once you start using them the disinhibition makes it that you cannot stop using them. You don't even need to blackout in order to compulsively use them - for e.g. a clonazepam taken orally with no tolerance will probably leave you semi-blackout for 3 days straight - maybe not enough to not remember anything but enough to compulsively eat another pill a day or two days later down the road.\n\nI'd say I'm currentely 90% healed. I can eat, I can think but there's no way for sure to say it hasn't left any scars on my brain. My anxiety is still there, has been for most of my life in fact that's why it's hard for me to assess the exact mental impact it left on me. I suppose I could try drinking a beer and see whether it causes another spike but quite frankly I'm too afraid to do that..\n\nI'm still mentally addicted to drugs and I'm still using different substances such as stimulants,opiates, weed but compared to benzos I'm able to use them in moderation and can safely say that they improve at least some aspects of my life. But as far as benzos are concerned they will always remain a poison for me which I'm still afraid of to this day and which I will advise against to anyone I'll have the opportunity to meet in the future.\n\nIf you are currently addicted and want to wean off see a doctor. When stopping abruptly you might die of seizures amongst other things.\n\nIf you are currently in a PAWS withdrawal I'll link the best site which helped me eliminate problematic spike inducing foods and herbs from my diet: http://w-bad.org/reactions-setbacks/",

I'm prescribed 30mg but I find it's too much, I feel zombie like and can't think. I've taken 15mg for quite a while which felt pretty good but I still found I had some negative effects so I switched to 10mg and have felt really good for about a week, but have started to feel weird and anxious on it. \n\nSo does anyone know what kinds of dosage amount might induce hormesis etc and what's a safe low dosage that would avoid that?\n\nAlso I'm 28, male, 76kg 181cm, if that helps\n\nEdit: when I say good, I mean relaxed and able rather than high or euphoric\n\nEdit2: read some convincing posts that low dose amphetamine sensitisation is a myth, please ignore",

Are there any other risks in doing this? \n\nI'd like to talk to my therapist about this as I rarely use these drugs to 'escape' my problems, but I'd like to be frank and open about everything as much as possible.

        "Hey.\n\nSo i took 0,3g of the mdma yesterday and i redosed it with 0,2g after like 2 and half or 3 hours. Everything was fine during rolling. After the roll, i had a little apathy like every time after roll. But i felt a little chest tightness. After a couple minutes i felt my chest tightness was more intense, but i thought it was just because i was a little thinking about it. It happened to me 2nd time inarrow and i never had it before. It lasts like 2 days or 2 and a half day. Is it normal during the mdma comedown, or i can have any heart problems ? \n\nThanks for replying everyone.\n\n\\*EDIT\\*\n\nAnd ye, i forgot to write that i was alone these 2 times inarrow when chest tightness happened. But i dont think it is a big problem cause i was alone many times before and for sure in a great mood listening to DnB or Suicide Boys. And i also felt like my farts where trapped. If you know what i mean ... But its normal that i cannot fart on mdma and like a 7 or a little more hours after. I can pee kinda normaly ... ye harder, but still i can pee during and after the rolling.",

Two chalupas on top of those. Generally don't eat at night, but I was out of control. Add half a joint, laced with a tiny bit of mint leaves, hibiscus tea, made with no respect. Just threw the tea bag in the water and microwaved for 3 mins. And I had one of the biggest body highs I have ever had, and the headspace was very spiritual and empathic.

        "This is just a post I made in order to share my personal experiences with **some** of the drugs I've tried and the problems I experience when taking them that other people do not seem to have. Hopefully I can gain some insight as to why this stuff happens to me and if I'm not alone. If you read all of this, thank you. I appreciate it. Anyways, here are my experiences:\n\n* **Adderall:** This is by far my favorite drug of all time for many reasons, and I've done a lot of shit including LSD and MDMA. It gives me the perfect high, makes me the person I long to be and just so happy. It's great for me considering I suffer from major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder. But the main issue I experience with Adderall is the fact that it lowers my sex drive, making it almost non-existant. I hear everybody say that if anything it makes sex all they can think about, being able to masturbate their heart out. It does make me last longer, but it doesn't make me think about sex or watching porn or anything. Is it supposed to or something? Because I'm not sure why it has this effect on me and the opposite for everybody else.\n* **Phenibut:** Nausea is the main issue I experience when taking this drug, especially in higher doses. And when it comes to lower doses, I don't feel anything. Is this normal for me to have to take at least 1.5g to even feel anything from it? And is there any way to prevent the nausea that comes with it when it does affect me?\n* **LSD:** This one is probably my own fault, but my main issue with LSD is bad trips. I've probably been doing it in the wrong set and setting, which is what's leading to them, but damn, Lucy just hasn't been nice to me lately. For my next trip I plan on taking it with some phenibut as apparently that's supposed to aid the trip and influence it for the better, almost like a guarenteed good trip is what I've heard people say about the combo.\n* **Marijuana:** This one's a doozy. Weed and I have never really got along unfortunately. I've made posts about my dislike for weed before, but I'll add it here too just because and keep it short (although [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/c1hsav/im_not_a_fan_of_marijuana/) the long version if you feel like giving it a read). Basically, weed just makes me very groggy, tired and releases no dopamine for me. It makes me ask why people even enjoy or would bother to do it really, so my theory is that it must affect others differently or something. I'm not trying to bash weed or shit talk those who use it at all so don't take it that way, I'm just saying that I personally am not a fan of it. If anybody can tell me in your experience what makes it so amazing for you exactly, I welcome your input.\n\nAnd that's it really. Like I said, these are only some of the drugs I've tried. I just wanted to share some of my experiences and the issues I have with them. Drugs have changed my life and I will always be thankful for them. Remember to stay safe and use responsibly. I love this community and appreciate all of the support and insight. It really means a lot and I don't know what I would do if it weren't for you guys. Thanks for reading.",

        "Honest question. I read all these websites about drugs and they all say that every single time you take a hit you have a chance of dying. They also say that you have a 25x greater chance of dying if you have alcohol in your system. \n\nThese claims seem kind of ridiculous to me as I know hundreds of people who do blow and many that do it on a consistent basis that have never overdosed or died. If the chances were this high wouldn't more people be dead? Wouldn't the club or bar bathroom be a horrific scene? It seems like every late teen and adult is doing blow to some extent. These websites make the drug seem like one of the most dangerous drugs in the world but I can't quite grasp my head around it.\n\nAre they bullshitting or am I crazy?",

He\u2019s off the respirator now but he\u2019s still in the hospital.\n\nI\u2019m very happy he\u2019s alive and i\u2019m very disappointed in him as i\u2019ve been worrying about him for years now cause his life sort of spiraled after he dropped out and saw the rest of us happily going through school and now living and working in a foreign country.\n\nI really love this man as he\u2019s literally my day one and I wish i could\u2019ve been telling him to be careful but i\u2019m unable to encourage him to be careful cause he takes it as i\u2019m looking down on him and yadda yadda and how he doesn\u2019t talk about my addictions (kratom, weed) etc so it\u2019s like you can\u2019t really even say anything even at this point\n\ni\u2019m sorry for just venting about it, my closest friends are all split up around north america and i don\u2019t have many close friends from back home to talk about it with so I\u2019ve really just been in my head trying to get through work everyday thinking about all the pain that is about to come into his realm along with his loved ones if he doesn\u2019t come out of this 100%.\n\nWe often forget to consider alcohol a drug as it\u2019s legal and everyone overindulges heavily into this substance all the while looking down on drug addicts while they behave like top cunts.\n\nJust pleas be careful guys, benzos and booze are really a very dangerous combo regardless of how much it is glorified in the shit rap music they crap out these days.\n\nDon\u2019t put your loved ones thru shit like this just cause you like to get fucked up\n\nit\u2019s really hard for us to see you like that",

Some people say its when you throw up from smoking too much, some people say its when you pass out from smoking too much, and others say its when you smoke to the point of being uncomfortable.\n\nPersonally, when I smoke too much weed (mostly with no tolerance), I tweak out, will zone out hard, and get extreme rushes of fear; on the verge of a panic attack. Although the biggest symptom is when I'm this high I will feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable. I feel uncomfortable under my own skin and extremely restless.\n\nIts a living hell tbh. \n\nThats what Id classify as greening out.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "I've used opiates on and off for the last few years. I've been a heavy user of drugs like benzos, psychedelics, amphetamines, dissociatives etc. over these years but nothing has ever had its claws as deep as opiates have.\n\nI was using mainly heroin, oxy and methadone for a while but I went through withdrawals and was put on Naltrexone and an SSRI to stop using.\n\nI stopped taking the Naltrexone a week ago because the craving for opiates was too strong. I used dihydrocodeine from wednesday to Friday in combination with weed.\n\nRight now I can't stop thinking about them, I know I shouldn't be using but opiates make my shitty life feel so peaceful and warm. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming the cravings?",

        "So my friends, as I have been unable to find any reliable data (hard enough to find the unreliable data) on microdosing MDMA I have taken it upon myself to explore this road myself. \n\nGoing into day 3 I have been taking 15mg of MDMA daily with very mild classical effects of the MDMA. At the end of day I have experienced significant mental clarity as well as slightly dillusional logic. I am aware that these miniscule dumps of serotonin may keep my brain from producing it in the future but this is typical with higher recreational doses. My idea (my fucked up hypothesis) is that with these smaller doses I can train or regulate my brain to recreate these effects in the longterm. Being clinically depressed I already produce little to no serotonin and am essentially trying to kickstart my brain.\n \n     Updates are sure to come.\n\nUpdate: On the sober morning before dosing on day 3, I feel absolutely amazing. I actually feel so good Im unsure if I will even take my day 3 dose. I feel better than I have in years.",

        "I started this account when I was spun out on Adderall and wanted to post my \"ultimate guide to Adderall\" which was quite popular and well received. I was using Adderall quite frequently, and when the supply ran out I switched to crystal meth. Wanted to share my findings, clear up some misinformation, and share the pros and cons of both substances. \n\n**ROA is Everything:** Taking meth orally or insufflated at low dose(15-25mg) without a tolerance the high is remarkably similar to Adderall. It feels like taking 40-60mg of XR that lasts twice as long, at low doses it actually feels cleaner with less side effects. When you smoke meth it's quite different, not entirely sure how I'd describe it, it doesn't really hit much faster than snorting, but smoking it makes it so much more addictive. You will be plenty high enough but crave hit after hit. The level and duration of high from smoking seems wildly unpredictable. It can be extremely euphoric or extremely anxiety inducing. \n\n**What does it feel like?** Imagine super long lasting Adderall with occasional euphoric rushes and empathetic feelings, kinda like what you get with MDMA, but much weaker, the lovey effects fade after regular use and it becomes pure stimulation. Meth also makes me horny as fuck and sex or masturbation feels incredible, far beyond anything I've experienced with any other stim. I'm a guy and can have orgasms that last a couple minutes while on meth. \n\n**Negative effects and harm vs Adderall** It's well known that meth is directly neurotoxic, although irreversible damage takes a long time to set in. Most people cannot use meth sparingly, but if you did manage to use it say once a month or less the negatives are pretty much identical. Acne and dry or oily skin, no appetite, anxiety, high blood pressure, dry mouth. The comedown is similar, mainly fatigue and depression. These can all be mitigated to some extent by forcing yourself to eat, sleep, and hydrate. \n\nWhat makes meth so much worse in this aspect is it's duration. Going on a 48 hour Adderall binge is difficult and quite expensive, if you're a first time meth user you can do this easily, just rail a 20mg line every 8 hours or so, for what I pay locally that means it takes about $5 worth of meth to go on a 48 hour binge, and you can keep going for a ridiculously long amount of time before the drug becomes pretty ineffective. This is usually what leads to stimulant psychosis, with meth it's possible for the average person to go as long as 5 days without sleep on less than $20 in drugs. In my experience I start feeling warning signs of psychosis at around 40 hours and that's when I've stopped. I've never exceeded a 2 day binge and I don't think I'd ever want to. With Adderall, by the time I hit 30+ hours it starts feeling like a caffeine pill, while meth just keeps going. \n\n**Addiction** Both drugs can by highly psychologically addictive when used recreationally. Taken orally, I don't think there's a significant difference. I was addicted to Adderall just as much as with meth, but ultimately the limited supply or high cost would force me to take a tolerance break regularly with Adderall. I believe the low cost, long duration, and option of smoking or IV use is what causes meth to be more destructive from an addiction standpoint. It's not typical for people to pick at their faces or act insane just because they're high on meth. The \"meth zombies\" you see are smoking or shooting it and staying up for days until they become psychotic, repeating the process for months or years. Meth cravings definitely seem stronger, but withdrawal is similar. Fatigue, depression, anhedonia, anxiety.. It's not an easy drug to quit, but it's nothing compared to what benzo or opiate addicts experience. \n\nIt's also fairly common for severely addicted people to become poly drug users and form a dependence on opiates or benzos as well. When tolerance increases you get a lot more negative effects such as anxiety/panic and pain from muscle tension and either being \"stuck\" in odd positions for a long time or overexerting yourself.  Benzos and opiates can both act as sort of an antidote to the shitty effects of meth, but being addicted to both makes the situation a lot worse. \n\n**Conclusion** One-off use of meth can be very similar to Adderall and the effects are exaggerated in my opinion. Not everyone that uses meth turns into a psychotic tweaker with sores all over their face, stealing bikes to fund their addiction. I think the stigma against users does more harm than good, as it drives them to only associate with other users. That being said there is definitely a greater risk with addiction and harm with long term use, so I wouldn't recommend it. If it's something you really want to try I'd advise against smoking it. After over a month of near daily use it's lost a lot of it's recreational value. I'm still very functional and sleep every night, but it's not really fun anymore and every day I continue to use this shit the high gets weaker and the side effects worse.  \n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I'd be happy to share.",

I only got one script of 60 8mg/2mg and that was in june I started tapering because I want off this shit. I got down to 1.50mg a day and my last piece was 5 days ago. I'd like to get kratom but will that even work or is the burp still filling my receptors? I've also got 600mg gabapentin, 2mg alprazolam  and so prescription strength Imodium all of which are prescribed. But my question would be, would kratom be of any help?",

It\u2019s very well produced and there\u2019s probably something really deep/something that hits home for everyone. Hard to watch at points. \n\n\nHave you guys seen it. If not, I think it\u2019ll be of interest to some of you. If you have. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts especially on the depiction of drugs and alcohol. \n\nCharacter limit",

I can feel again, feel all the emotions I didnt want. I know now that to feel anything, even the constant sadness, is better then letting the nothingness eat away at me until all that was left was skin and bone and xanax. \n\nNever fucking do xanax it's not worth it to not feel yall. I never thought I'd be able to do it and now I made it 11 days sober and never felt better. I urge everyone out there struggling please get help. If I can do it you can too.",

They think they're getting pure coke, and I tell them everytime that they aren't. You can't get pure stuff in the UK very easily (even with the dark web) because people are always bashing it on the way down.\n\n\nSo my question is, how can people bash it and still make it look like its off the block? I want to be able to tell people that their coke isn't as good as they think it is, and I want to open their eyes to potentially better cocaine.\n\n\nI had some Albanian coke in germany that blew my socks clean off, even the rocks in UK are nowhere near in comparison. What are dealers in my area doing to make people think their coke is better than it actually is?",

        "Did 225mg Benadryl/Diphenhydramine last night. It was absolutely lovely, I took a very strong edible first, so I don\u2019t remember which kicked in first, but it was really relaxing. I had no true visuals when my eyes were open (I was in my dark bedroom watching That 70\u2019s Show and listening to music) and no one was home. But I heard many of things, I kept hearing my mother yelling at me and trying to be angry, but the weed calmed me down which was kinda nice. It was fun experimenting with reality. Only negative is that I was hyper aware of my heartbeat, it felt like it was going 200 beats per minute. It was intense, I could feel it internally and with my hand on my chest. It scared me, and anytime I heard my mom, it sped up again. When I could finally get myself to a restful sleepy state instead of being \u201cwired\u201d and hyper at midnight, I closed my eyes and had really amazing visuals like a Travis Scott music video lol. I likely will be doing more Benadryl on it\u2019s own tonight, and I\u2019m hoping for another fun time. I know it has a bad wrap, but as long as you tell yourself and remind yourself frequently that the noises and faces aren\u2019t real, you should enjoy yourself. Will update this later tonight when I\u2019m on Benadryl again. Doing 200mg this time.",

        "I remember the times in my life when I had friends were the times when I smoked weed at parties and social occasions. Other than the usual conversation starts 'How did you learn to roll? 'when do you think it will be legal?', the pretense of doing something we shouldn't together and the way it allowed me to just roll with enjoying senseless videos with someone or just not speak at all because we were high really helped me build long term friendships. At one point however, I made the mistake of getting into a relationship with a girl who wanted to bring me on a 'self improvement' journey which involved 'cutting out the people who aren't adding to my life'. The argument was that 'if the substance of my relationships is substance abuse itself, there's nothing worth saving'. Its not exactly as if I had a choice in this matter - I had already said I loved here too early which in retrospect wasn't love for me but a complicated feeling I associated with growing up that boiled down to 'you seem like a reliable person to help me through my Masters Degree I want to stay with you'.\n\nThree years later and I've been doing contract which in different cities which has meant moving around a lot. I finally decided I want to settle in Germany and I've been looking for something more permanent in Berlin, but it seems like the best way all my immigrant friends have integrated is through weed. I try but every time now I go through the same mental process of first questioning if my perceptions are on point, getting suspicious of others intentions, retreating to me with myself and writing things through, thinking about all the mistakes I've made in my life, writing my priorities out, doing small administrative tasks and cleaning my space and finally concluding that I need to go to church to get normal and praying for help. \n\nIts a bit of a wakeup call for me because my life is a total mess but its also not a very sociable thing to try. This never used to happen but now it always happens the same way, including at parties.  Am I psychologically balanced, is there something deeper wrong with me?",

        "I understand LSD and magic mushrooms differ regardless of inducing similar effects, and that shrooms tends to be less intense (depending on the dosage).  \n\n\nHowever these are typically drugs that may impact different people in different ways, and Id be interested in getting to know how they affect you personally.  \nIf you want me to be honest I've never actually tripped before, except on a **very low** dosage of psilocybin(shrooms).  \nI used to smoke weed a bit more often then I do now, though regardless of how high I've gotten in the past, I wouldn't necessarily label the experience as \"a trip\".  \n\n\nI've been researching drugs on the internet since I was in my later teens, though it's been a while since I've thought of it!  \n\n\n**PS:** Only answer the question if you're near positive you've taken legit LSD, rather than some other research chemical (such as 25i-nbome)  \n\n\nI'm pretty sure most people on this subreddit already understand the differences between the two. It typically extremely easy to research",

About dosing: if I get a safe dose of H and a safe dose of coke, and not take any more after the initial dose, it's safe right? I see a lot of confusing info on the internet about this. Is it dangerous because people take more H after the initial dose, or is it dangerous because somehow using coke with H lowers the overdose limit?\n2. What if I add meth into the mix? How much more dangerous is a single administration of the 3-drug combination compared to just coke and H? For people who have done this before, is it a better or worse experience than regular speedball?\n3. Does lack of experience in using opiates ruin the experience? It took 3 tries for me to get a proper opiate high, the first 2 I just got constipated and puked. I don't want to use opiates regularly just to prepare for this. Haven't used any in like 7 years and I've never really used regularly.",

        "I'm thinking of trying 5g of shrooms, i know it is an extremely intense trip and i might have a trip sitter with me. I have some experience with psychedelics, i can handle 250ug of LSD very well and I can handle 600mg of DXM very well. These doses are the highest i've ever taken, and i've taken them a lot. However, these doses seem kind of mild to me and for a while i've felt like i'm ready to move on to something much bigger. I dont want to have a first time shroom trip that resembles my acid trips, i am looking for something much stronger as I feel that now is the time that i should fully delve into the psychedelic dimensions.  \n\nAm i ready for 5g of shrooms? How intense is it exactly? \n\nWill i be able to think properly? How hard is it to navigate this state of consciousness? \n\nRecently i've been feeling positive, but not long ago i was struggling with intense existential anxiety. Will  5 grams bring up that fear? Or if i let go then will i have a good chance of minimizing my fears or even avoiding fears? \n\nAlso, i have one very important question about the sensitivity to psilocybin. I have heard stories of some people who have an unusually high sensitivity to psilocybin, they would take like 4 grams and end up tripping as hard as like 20 grams. Could someone enlighten me here?\n\n\n\nAny replies will be very appreciated :)",

        "So I recently got a good job stopped all drugs just drink now. I come home after being gone awhile and decide I'm gonna invite a friend over I haven't seen in a while who kept asking to hang out. It was me two other friends and we are gonna refer to the other friend at coke boy. So coke boy has a problem hes told not to bring coke to my house. So he decides to bring weed and just one beer which he bummed off his weed guy. The night was great then I accidentally knock over a $40 steam roller (was not his) \nSo I apologized and was like dude I'll pay you tmr were all drunk I have no cash rn. We can go in the morning. No big deal right? \nOh this guy fucking flips gets in my face and starts yelling I want my fucking 40 bruh you just threw my piece on the ground. So I say again no dude it was an accident I'll pay you tmr. Coke boy gets belligerent confesses to killing two people over money and starts threatening me so I'm like dude just leave get tf out you're tweaking out over nothing. This is a guy I've been friends with for 6 years now. I knew he was bad off now not that he came from a bad home. Really good and wealthy home actually but I felt bad hes been down the wrong path since 11th grade so I wanted to see how he was doing. \nWell coke boy hit me maybe 8 times and I refused to hit back because to me it was all a joke and tbh I was afraid I'd be his third victim.\nLuckily one of my friends grabbed him and took him outside. \nI was ready to kill this guy because he attempted to over $40 that he couldn't have immediately. So my friend lies and says coke boy is gone we are coming back in. I unlock the door and coke boy comes running in and tries stealing my phone and my mons work phone which is just WHAT!? but he then takes all the beer out of my fridge and puts it in a rain jacket he took off my wall.",

I know it was really dumb to not test before trying it but we had gotten some pure M we tested from the same place. I also tested negative for amph the next day.

I tried cocaine in small amounts and it was subtle but nice it gave me energy but it was subtle and I could handle it. Mainly made me want to walk and do things with my friends. Is ketamine anything like weed anxiety wise. I like benzos a lot is it similar? I am talking about one small line just to try it. Will it made me nauseous paranoid dizzy and give me adrenaline rushes? Or is it worth trying? I am on klonopin and paroxetine but I don't think that's a problem",

        "Im at work and came across a script of 10mg valiums, i started taking 20mg, felt a small buzz but not much, so took another 30mg, didn\u2019t feel anything much other than slightly more talkative. now i\u2019ve taken about 60mg more over the last couple hours and i still feel relatively sober. any idea why? this is a legitimate script from a pharmacy. i do occasionally take xanax maybe twice a month but no more than 2-3mg at a time so i wouldn\u2019t figure id have a high tolerance as i don\u2019t have a script for those. I\u2019m a male roughly 240lb if that makes a difference. I don\u2019t feel any negative effects either. is there a cap limit on the effects ? i\u2019m not combining with anything else either and this is my first experience with it. i\u2019m a bit underwhelmed but maybe someone can answer my question, thank you.",

        "I\u2019ve took Quetiapine for a few years. It helped me sleep and reduced my anxiety during the day. I\u2019ve started on 25mg, bumped it up to 50mg for a few months and back to 25mg. I\u2019m pretty sensitive to drugs, I can\u2019t even drink a small cup of coffee without getting tremors.\n\nThe problem I had with it is that it would make me sleep for too long, like, 12 hours, and I wasn\u2019t happy with it anymore. So, this week I went to the doctor and got prescribed 50mg Trazodone instead.\n\nThe thing is, I haven\u2019t slept properly since. Takes me hours to actually drift away and because of that I end up getting out of bed at the same time I did on Quetiapine, only with less hours of sleep.\n\nBut the worst part is that the anxiety is back. I wake up and I can\u2019t eat or drink. I feel cold almost shaking and that feeling of impending doom I knew so well before...\nAlso a bit itchy... and no unwanted boners lol.\n\nNow, is this because it will take some time for the Trazodone to start working? Is it Quetiapine abstinence or something? It\u2019s been 4 days and I\u2019m wondering if I should hang on for more time or if it\u2019s clear it\u2019s not working?\n\nThanks :)",

        "Sorry guys for forgetting to post more stories after so many of you asked me to do so, to be honest the first story was written on speed and I just ran out of speed quickly so obviously now I'm not nearly as verbose lol.\n\nThis story happened about two years ago, when I was a young  stoner who had just recently discovered the wonders of weed to himself. Nowadays I can't smoke at all due to depressive episodes and anxiety that I started experiencing from weed, but back then I couldn't have enough of that shit. And especially I loved hash, more so than plain flower. \n\nIf you remember my previous post and the other \"drugs in russia\" post by another dude on here who explained how stuff works in this vodka-soaked country, you probably already know that the way we get drugs is sort of a fucked-up game of geocaching. Geocaching with drugs as the endgame and cops in civilian clothes eager to get your ass, to be exact. \n\nSo, as I'm checking the marketplace, I stumble upon a position which says \"\u0426\u0410\u041e \u042d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\" as the approximate part of the city where the stuff is hidden. \u0426\u0410\u041e means \"central administrative district\", basically the very center of the city, and \"\u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\", well, means \"extreme\". So I thought, what the hell do they mean by \"extreme\"? Well, I just assumed that it's a name of a park or a shopping mall or something. Boy how wrong I was...\n\nI pay in bitcoin, open the description of the address, and I see that the motherfucker has actually hidden the stuff RIGHT by the Kremlin. The most crowded, most guarded, most loaded by police part of the entire fucking city. \n\nSee [this fucking ark here](http://photos.sochi.org.ru/var/albums/voyages/moscou/Kremlin-Grotto.jpg?m=1355146041)? To be precise, not the arc with the big white columns, but that small stone opening on the right. Yeah, that genius hid the stuff in some sort of opening between the stones inside, sticking it in the hole with fucking plasticine, the kind that kids play with. \n\nObviously I'm shitting my pants, I called my friend and his gf for backup, said friend is sort of a homeless raver kind of dude who has seen all kinds of shit so I felt safe with him in this quest. After some swearing and laughter at the absurdity of the situation, we did manage to pick it up, and found out that the vendor had actually included a bonus for us, since it was such an EXTREME quest! It was supposed to be only one gram of hash for about 12 dollars, but what we got in there was like 1.5g of hash plus 0.3-0.5g of some good bud. \n\nAll said and done, we smoked the bud in an abandoned yard that was left in place of a demolished building, a mere house away from the local police department. It was some good bud :)",

        "i used to trip a lot back in 2017 and early 2018 and back then i used to have very intense trips, no matter how close in time the trips were or the amount it was. i could still intensely feel the acid even if one tabs and needed about two for visuals. i started doing acid again at the beginning of this year and have done it about 10-12 times since but every single time that i have i havent been able to feel it AT ALL. the last time i did acid was about two nights ago for the first time in 2-3 months and i took four tabs, and my pupils did dilate but i could not sense that i was on tripping at all and felt perfectly sober. why is it that i cant feel the acid anymore no matter how many tabs that i take? acid used to be my favorite drug (besides molly) because i loved learning and how i viewed the world on it. i havent done shrooms anytime recently so im not sure if i react that way with shrooms as well but it just sucks because im not able to sense the beauty of acid anymore and its also a waste of money at this point :\\ \n\nhas anybody else experienced this? and if so how can you reverse it if possible?? \n\nalso that night i decided to drink alcohol thinking it might help the acid kick in, which it did not and couldnt get drunk either and just felt perfectly in my normal state of mind. wackkkkk ):",

        "Hello. \nLet me just say that I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was around 13, I am now 25. The thing is, I have tried pretty much every antidepressant in the book. I would wait patiently for them to take effect but usually nothing would happen. I just left the psychiatrist's office and I'm wondering if it's even worth it anymore to keep trying these things. They just wrote me a prescription for 75 MG Wellbutrin. I have to say that the only medicine that really helped me was the kind that helps you concentrate, because they made me comfortably numb. I was on something called Vyvanse when I was in the 11th grade, and I was numb for just about the whole year and my grades were really good. I don't take that anymore. Anyway, I might just end up self medicating... Just trying different things, but nothing too extreme obviously. I'm sure you've heard Robocough. Oh sure, it's not the healthiest thing in the world but dammit, it helps as long as I don't take too much. The only problem with that is my boyfriend keeps butting in and telling me he doesn't like me taking it, but I can't really talk to him about my depression, and there's nothing he can really do so, it is what it is. This might not be the most appropriate place to post this but thanks anyway.",

Decent shrooms trip left me with some lingering depression/weirdness, finally I'm seeing outside of that weirdness, and it's bringing me such intense sadness where I am crying throughout the day (I'm a grown ass man and never do this btw) and it feels fucking amazing to be in touch with my emotions again, which I feel I lost for a month.\n\nCan anyone relate?",

I spit and it was foamy. I looked at myself in the mirror and my teeth and gums were covered in foam like how'd you imagine a rabid dog. I figured I was dehydrated and drank a bunch of water but the foam kept coming back. It went away after a while and I forgot about it but it's kinda strange looking back. I've googled around and it doesn't seem like that was a normal thing.... Like it signals a serious health issue.\n\nAnyone else ever experience this? Is it a low-key thing or was I on the verge of having a seizure or something?\n\nThanks for any thoughts.",

        "I feel as if people mistake Xanax as euphoric due to the relaxation they feel. I know it feels like sitting down next to a fire place with a cup of hot chocolate in your hands. But it\u2019s not true euphoria. The drug is pretty much shit in my book I don\u2019t see any recreational value in it. And pharmacologically there\u2019s no influence on dopamine receptors directly or indirectly that most other drugs would provide. I feel like teens are just getting into it because rappers glorify it. The drug is highly addictive physically and it\u2019s just not something I think people should try it\u2019s really not great in anyway. I\u2019ve tried low doses from .25mg to 3mg at a time I just don\u2019t see any recreational euphoria. Honestly there are way better drugs. Don\u2019t try Xanax\n\nEdit: Many people are bring up its use for anxiety when obviously yes that will bring on a greater sense of euphoria due to the complete change it mindset. But I\u2019m not talking about that. I\u2019m talking about it\u2019s use for recreational purposes not medicinal.\n\nEdit 2: I was made aware of the health problems that come along with its use. More than I realized which most people would assume comes along with benzo use anyway. Regular benzo users read the link. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_long-term_benzodiazepine_use",

        "I quit amphetamines after about 1 year's usage.  At first it was Vyvanse from a doctor (at an escalating dose), then I snorted/smoked meth for a month or so and quit cold turkey.  This was a few months ago, but I was probably 98% normal around 3-4 weeks clean.\n\nI'm clean now, life is more or less normal, and I think I've mostly moved on from speed.  I've got a life full of goals and aspirations, and while drugs have in the past clouded those for just a moment, I've always been aware of the bottom line.\n\nGiven meth's notoriety for addictiveness and consuming lives, I think it's significant how I walked away from it so easily.  I'm not saying I have a god-given anti-addictive talent, but rather that drugs are often exaggerated in their effects.\n\nI'm kind of tempted to try some sort of narcotic, but I fear that, if not heroin right off the get go, I'll escalate into heroin because I want to see the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of opiods.  Deep down, I feel like I'm waiting for someone to comment \"go ahead, it's not that bad\", because I'm goddamn curious.\n\nI hope someone can sway my opinion.  About a month before I did meth, I made a post like this and convinced myself I still hadn't made up my mind, but I really had.\n\nI don't know what exactly I want to hear, but I just need something.",

        "[advice ](https://www.crew.scot/drug/mdma/)\n\nSo I\u2019m moving to university in September and after speaking to my flat mates we\u2019ve decided to go to a few techno and drum and bass events. Long story short they all like to take drugs and I\u2019ve been interested in the idea of it for a while just a bit anxious about It. I\u2019m a 19 year old male with asthma. My concern is about my heart rate increasing and worrying id be having some sort of panic attack which could lead to an asthma attack. From what I\u2019ve read around the web I\u2019ve heard bombing it could be good for first time use, however I\u2019ve just learnt you can dab MDMA.  Would this be like literally licking my finger putting it into a bag of mdma and rubbing it into my gums? If so how effective is this and any pointers or advice would be great. Thank you all!",

        "Just like yesterday, I just now took my second bowl of 60% hash (it's made by Biscotti) and high grade bud out of the bong, and I go \"Whoa, here we go again!\" and I'm sent into a 15-20 minute swirl of empathetic feelings, (I read a kid's suicide attempt taking some DPH and tripping horribly yesterday, felt in his shoes, regretted even the one time I dared do that), resolvements to do right, intense introspection particularly at my past opiate, benzo and alcohol abuse, and my current, lowered, prescribed use/beer drinking, and a bit of self-trial type shit goes on. \n\nThis isn't completely bad. Years ago when I first started smoking, it was given to me as though it was a second, safer alcohol. I did not take it that way, and at 15 I definitely was uncomfortable with smoking weed and then thinking \"Man, put out that fucking cigarette. Why are you drinking so damn much, you need to stop\", but I knew it was right. Nowadays, it is useful to scare me straight in those first 15-20 minutes of effect, and the reward is nice as the high tapers off and affects my body (Indicas all day). Oddly enough, high-dose edibles (I like to take 2-300mg) never has this effect on me and I've never had a bad time with edibles in my life. I credit this to the instant come-on of the THC in smoking. \n\nThe only thing is, I need to take the lessons, and not self-persecute.",

Which sucks cause you like getting Hugh but you can\u2019t do it I never k new what I looked like but my friend with asthma and I smoked together and he looked fucked up in healthy breathing all weird and heavy it\u2019s just not right. Asthma in some way is a curse because I had the potential to become a stoner and be popular with my friends and my family never cared that I did it until I had a bad asthma attack and had to be sent to the hospital on multiple occasions. I used to juul too which seemed like was worse than smoking weed for a little known fact that CBD can open your lungs so maybe that\u2019s why I kept my self alive for the time I did it. Again not recommended I\u2019ve felt at times I was going to do and the worse paranoia. End of story \n\nI don\u2019t vape or smoke anymore but I do dip a lot I guess it a lesser of most Evils when September roles around in my state tobacco can\u2019t be purchased until 21 which really sucks",

Basically title.\n\nSpeed is my favorite drug, I often mix it with MDMA and I love it.\n\nI know there's a thing where poeple mix MDMA and LSD and appearently it's super nice.\n\nAnyway. For my birthday today i was thinking about mixing the 3 of them, and I was wondering if anybody actually tried it and could give me some feedback.\n\nIf anything I'd be ready to drop the speed and only do LSD and MDMA, but I'm curious about how it is too.\n\nEdit: Decided to do candy flipping tonight, so mixing LSD with MDMA. No speed :)",

        "One of my friend was running out of greens so he wanted to buy some from me when we meet at our workplace, McDonald's. However he overlooked his shift so we never met. So the weed stayed in my backpack.\n\nAt that time, I was at my grandmother's place and I departed to Switzerland 2 days after that. Since I left from my grandmother's house, not from home I couldn't just leave the stuff at her place so I took it with me... Aaall the way from Hungary to Switzerland, needless to say I was a bit scared on every border but it was like 2g and we were sitting on a bus full of children.. Oh yeah, the occasion! I was the interpreter of the Hungarian Delegation for the International Youth Firefighters Competition in Martigny. Nothing too serious...\n\nWe had to stay there for a whole week, it is like a giant festival and firefighter gathering all organised around an international competition and a great prize. On one of the evenings after talking to some Finnish, Croatian, French and basically every kind of person, I got bored, since every youngster who competes had to go into their room by 23:00. Then I saw a group co-leader from our delegation who was just as bored as me and we talked earlier about smoking weed and stuff. He was walking back to the hotel and I said jokingly that \"I have weed on me, do you want to smoke?\". I was surprised when he said yes... XD \n\nAfter some hesitation I sneaked into our room where the other delegation leaders were sleeping, grabbed my little glass container and walked out as fast as I could. I told him that I know a place that is all dark and is a perfect spot. I have to say that I saw people smoking weed there earlier and from the smell it was certainly weed... The local \"gangsters\" were pretty careless about choosing spot btw I saw many smoking casually at benches and stuff.\n\nSo yeah, we rolled it up, smoked it and went for a late night walk in Martigny, which really is beautiful at night. If you saw two red eyed blokes at around 1 am wandering on the streets, that was us!\n\nWell, this is my story, nothing too special, but at least I can say that I was \"tripping\" both legally and illegally at the same time. I am looking forward to read similiar stories in the comments!",

        "Ever since I had a very bad trip on LSD in March I haven\u2019t been able to smoke weed at all without getting really bad anxiety. I can\u2019t even smoke half a joint without feeling like my heart is going to stop. I\u2019ve been smoking since I was 14 and I\u2019m 21 now. \n\nI\u2019m mainly looking for insight about if it will get better or if I should just stay away from it forever. I loved weed so much and it honestly makes me sad I can\u2019t feel okay while smoking. \n\nThis question mainly came up because I\u2019m going to a music festival in the end of September and I would love to smoke I just don\u2019t want to freak out. Also, (sorry for this post jumping all over) I can\u2019t take MDMA without throwing up or feeling sick to my stomach. I do have GERD so that might be a reason why. But again, I want to take it at the festival. Is there a better way to take it than just a cap? \n\nSorry this post kinda jumps but I\u2019m just curious",

        "So this story happened today(about 5 minutes ago) and basically I got 20 bucks by selling a vape because nicotine is bad. And I wanted to buy some bars, so I found a guy who said he would hook it up last night. So today I went to the skatepark cus the homie needed a smoke and i wasnt about to let a homie down.\n\nAs I pullup there I saw the nigga I was talkin to about xans and I went to go talk to him about it. He said he ain't got no xans but he got codiene and would gimme aprox~ 3 pour ups. And me being the druggie I am I said \"bet\" \n\nSo he pours me up and i pullup to the homies house and he gives me some tramadol because he abused the fuck out of it a few nights in a row (37.5tram/325acetominophen) and I was lookin to get a nice high so I took em\n\nWe pour up do our thing, get the high whatever. We go for a walk to our local skatepark and i cussed out some bitches cus they ugly as fuck and deserved it. And we decided to head back to his house, me and his brother are chillin in his room and his mom decides to come in as hes shitting and ask for help loosing a lug nut. I said \"alright, but what's a lug nut\" and as I said that he walks into the room. It was a very awkward experince but I'm glad it happened on opiates because they have almost no tells.\n\n1/10 would not recommend a homies mom walking in on you fucked on opiates\n\nEdit 1: we decided that trampoline would be a good idea and made me feel sober:((. We also decided to make someone pullup so we can get hugs\n\nEdit 2: smoked pot, dissoisoint 2 minute trip, feel great and music sounds 100\u00d7 better\n\nEdit 3: nodding out rn well still very high and I'm not liking this, so I'm buying a coffee and smokin more//update after\n\nEdit 4: I think I'm coming down and I dislike it. Some shit just happened and I dont need to feel, so I snagged some weed of a friend (I'll pay him back, he said he would blaze) so ima bout to do that",

        "My little brother has been battling addiction now for about 5 years.  When it started he was about 18 and I was around 25.  He is now 23 and I am 30.  Today he called me from the rehab facility (probably 6th or 7th rehab over 5 years) and told me he is probably looking at 3 - 5 years in prison.  I'm not quite sure why I am writing this, but I have to get it out of my system.  I feel completely lost.  I have known for quite some time that it would either be prison or death, and the day of reckoning has arrived.  Honestly, I won't be surprised if he kills himself, or attempts to between now and the hearing.  It all started with him taking a Vicodin.  He was young and just had his heart broken by a high school crush.  The pills escalated from Vics to Percs, to oxytocin, and then ended with the old powder.  Xanax and cocaine along the way.  Overdoses, run-ins with police, pills purchased from dark web, and so much more have been the reality of my family.  I don't live back Home anymore and pretty much haven't since I graduated college.  I have seen what this has done to my parents (who are divorced), and I am so angry.  I once was full of hope, and now that tank of hopefulness is empty.  I cannot do anything to help or change this outcome, and coming to this realization is one of the hardest things for me to accept.  I cannot help and I feel absolutely helpless.  I am resentful and wish he would just disappear, but I know the aftermath will be my mess to pick up.  It is an awful feeling to know there is nothing you can say or do to make this better.  I don't even care what happens to my baby brother anymore.  I have been pushed to feeling this way about my own little brother and it makes me wonder am I broken?  The one I grew up with, played with, fought with, laughed with, and so much more. I hate who he is now.  I hate that every accomplishment I have had in life has been overshadowed by his illness.  I hate that for 5 years I have been the afterthought of my parents.  I hate that I truly feel he is a criminal and belongs in jail.  I hate that there will be no happy ending for this story and my parents who are both almost 60 will spend the last bit of their lives feeling like complete shit because of him.  I hate that I have to let my parents go because they can't let him go.  I am not looking for sympathy or anything, I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head and put them somewhere.  If you are still reading this and you haven't had something like this in your life happen, I want you to see what happens when you abuse and become addicted hard drugs.  It breaks the people you love.  It has broken my parents.  It has broken parts of me.  Sorry for the incoherent, sporadic, nonsensical rambling.  I feel a tad better now.",

        "I\u2019ve only tried tabs twice. The first time I tried it, it was going well, i went for a nice walk with a mate and i started having light visuals and felt pretty relaxed. When we got back to my car, the cops were parked right next to us (what are the fucking chances) so we hopped in and drove off back to our area. I was still feeling fine throughout all of this - no paranoia or anything. And then my mate offers me some cones and everything changed. At first, smoking felt so fun and easy but all of a sudden, i freaked out. The concept of time disappeared, i felt like i was seeing through the future and the past all at once and i wanted out. I tell my mate im not feeling well and i want to get out of it and he\u2019s like \u201cum,, we got like like at least another 10 hours of this..\u201d. I was full panicking but luckily, my friend started telling me stories and i calmed down and we ended up having a decent night.\n\nThe second time i tried tabs, i was on a weekend getaway and again, went for a walk with the same mate. We watched Lion King together and it just felt like I had high definition eye sight and the world looked a little bit prettier. When we got back to the airbnb, it was pre late and about 10 hrs had passed so we decided to call it a night. My mate was quite sleepy but i wasnt so i thought maybe smoking cones would help me doze off. As soon as we smoked some cones, my mate instantly falls asleep and I start having some really trippy and dark thoughts. I didnt freak out like last time because I kept trying to remind myself that it was the bud but i couldnt shake off the scary thoughts.\n\nHas anyone else had a good tab trip turn sour from bud? Is that meant to happen? To be honest though, being on tabs alone just feels like being sober with visuals so I\u2019m not sure?",

        "Substances; MDMA (lots of), Ketamine, weed, diazepam, alcohol... possibly something else I don't remember\n\nAfter my last hit of K and my last few tokes I lay down  and I saw a woman made of liquid gold with her back turned, sitting legs crossed (I think), and moving one arm above her head while the other was at her side and visa versa. It was very elegant. When I say liquid gold I mean shining flowing metal glittering with every motion.\n\nShe seemed Indian or thereabouts for some reason. I checked online and sure enough there is a Hindu god/aspect called Durga often depicted in gold with many arms. I wonder if this is a representation of the movement of the arms depicted fairly crudely in an artist's rendition.\n\nHaving read a little I think there might be a reason for her to appear to me. It's kinda uncanny. Then again I have been to India and probably seen a statue somewhere like that and it was just a memory. Still slightly out there though. Especially right now when I'm still a bit high.",

Same fight over and over. I didnt wanted her to know in the first place and she found out. She already knew like a year ago but i got caught and had to stop and now she returned to the same state. Like im the same guy with or without the drugs why is she soo annoying. I cant go a day without her talking about me smoking. Everytime i go out with friends is \"are you going to smoke agian\". I just want to lock my door and never talk to her she doesnt give me a little bit of space or privacy. Im doing my SIT exam now and need support from her but she doesnt accept to help me. Just blaming the weed for my problems. For example yesterday i had to catch up on everything i missed while we were at germany and stayed up late doing my work and the day before i had a girl sleeping over. Soo i had few hours of sleep and i asked her to help me get up in the morning cus i got sleeping problems since ever. And she blames it on the weed that i dont wake up and i missed todays meeting..",

        "EDIT: (please read first) My dad hasn't needed these meds in 3 years, and he built a tolerance to them, therefore he is very unlikely to need or use them again. For those who thought he needed them. I'm not that much of a shitty person lol. If he needed them I definitely wouldn't have touched them.\n\nSo yesterday was probably the best day to do drugs in Florida. It was raining, my parents were out, and my brother in his room. ((A bit of back story, my dad hurt his back real bad and was prescribed Percocets (oxycodone/acetaminophen)). So I figured, hey this is a good time to try opioids.\n\nI crushed the Percocet, and put it on top of Nutella on a cracker. Down the hatch and about an hour later, my legs are numb, I'm 100% at peace with the world and I was so relaxed and euphoric, it honestly wasn't very intense, so the next time I try it I'm gonna up my dosage about 1/3 of a tab and see where that takes me.\n\nThis is a pretty pointless post, but it made me feel better by talking about it, just takes some of the guilt, or nervous energy away. If you could post your experiences with Percocets, it'd be great, just a way to compare and contrast between other people's experiences because I find drugs and their effects interesting, which is something I hope my parent's never hear! \n\nThis is NOT something I will do for a very long time due to them being highly addictive, and I do NOT condone the abuse of opioids. This was simply experimental for my benefit, and to share my experience.",

        "I'm a huge fan of the amphetamine RC's (orally only) such as 4F-MPH, 4F-EPH, 2-FA, 2-FMA, 3FPM. They all give me a noticeable boost to my productivity, energy and motivation. Especially the phenidates as they do not have nearly as much of the tolerance and addiction potential of the latter three dopamine releasers.\n\nProblem is that where I live they're not always readily available. Years ago when I first tried speed I never felt much either and couldn't find any analogues so I used methamphetamine for a while which works better but has too many side effects and withdrawal issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain I'm in a situation where all my favorites are unavailable so I'm driven to speed or meth. This time I thought maybe the speed i had years ago was just shit so I got a hold of 10g of pure white speed paste advertised as 70% pure. It wasn't very wet so I left it to dry in the sun for most of the day and occasionally cut it up until it was relatively dry.\n\nWeight wise it went from 10g to 9757mg so it really didn't have much \"water\" weight to it. The powder was slightly tacky but dry enough so I put it in a glass and filled it up with probably 300ml of industrial grade acetone. I put the cup into a hot water bath to speed up the reaction, then thoroughly mixed it for about 5mins with a spoon to get out all the lumps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while I dumped it into another glass with filter paper attached to it, poured some more acetone onto it for good measure and let it dry for about an hour, occasionally disturbing the speed sludge to get out all the acetone. What was left in the glass with the acetone was a pure white cloudy/milky substance which floated around in the center of the acetone. Anyways, I ripped open the coffee filter and spread the amph over a plate and essentially done the same as the first dry up.\n\nI ended up with 7063mg of a pure white fine dry amph powder. (Removing 2694mg of junk)\n\nYesterday I tried 50mg orally, and again I didn't feel much so I re-dosed 25mg nasally to see if anything would happen. Today I started with 75mg orally which felt like the 50mg dose but with slightly more physical effects (increased heart-rate and perspiration, jaw clenching, dry mouth etc). 4hrs later I thought fuck it and took 100mg, again I knew I was on a stimulant but there was mostly just physical side effects with no noticeable motivation enhancement or any cognitive effects for that matter so I redosed another 50mg 3hrs later and here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must admit the speed has to have had an effect on my productivity considering how much effort i put into writing this but the physical aspect of it far outweighs the cognitive and thats really annoying as I do not like to take more than threshold/light doses for focus. Also I dont like sniffing it because Its just the same as oral but less consistent in its productive aspects. Also I've been assessed for adhd and they said im likely to have it but im still waiting to see a psychiatrist for treatment. Is it worth buying more acetone and washing it extensively? otherwise I have the means to isolate dex amph from the racemic amph but It is a hassle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I washed my speed and was still shit. May have adhd and meth is too troublesome.",

        "This story takes place back when I was in the 8th grade.\n\nAt that age, I was smoking weed at any given opportunity. Getting stoned was pretty much my absolute main goal in life. I didn't really care about anything else.\n\nI had friend who was completely sober, who I'll refer to as Jake.\n\nJake was much older than me, probably in his early 20's. He didn't smoke weed, didn't smoke cigarettes, didn't drink, and didn't experiment with any type of drugs whatsoever. Compared to me, he could've been considered straight-edge. And he always looked down on me for smoking weed. Over the past year, it became incredibly awkward for him to spend time with me due to my marijuana use. And honestly, looking back now, I don't blame him for wanting to keep his distance. I was a pathetic unstable burnout at the time.\n\nBut one day, he agreed to spend time with me. Him and I were riding bikes around the neighborhood. We went a nearby church, where I then proceeded to light up a bowl. This was some super, super potent stuff. Straight up kush. Probably some of the strongest weed I've ever got my hands on. For whatever reason, I then relentlessly begged Jake to take a hit. I was like, \"Oh come on man! Just take one hit! It's not gonna hurt you! Try it, just this once!\" Seriously, I was acting like the devil. I wouldn't take no for an answer. I literally stood there for like 30 whole minutes trying to persuade him. And I must say, he didn't break under pressure that easily. But then, at the last minute, Jake said, \"Alright f#cker, hand it over!\" He then took a massive hit from the bowl and coughed his lungs out. Keep in mind, this was the very first time Jake ever smoked...like anything.\n\nMoments later, Jake had a really weird look on his face. It was a facial expression of immediate panic, anxiety, and discomfort. He then sorta dropped to his knees and started awkwardly chasing around some leaves in the grass. I looked over and asked, \"Uh, Jake, what are you doing?\" He then mumbled, saying, \"I don't feel good. I think I'm about to die.\" I then did my best to explain that he was just really high, and that the feeling would eventually pass. He then started sweating like crazy. He looked at me and said, \"Dude, you don't understand! I don't feel good! Why did you do this to me?! How do I make it stop?!\" He was clearly tripping. I then continued to try to keep him calm and tell him that everything was gonna be alright.\n\nHe then said, \"I need to go home and get some sleep.\" Keep in mind, it was like 1 in the afternoon. He then started crying, jumped on his bike, and took off. I felt so bad for him. Obviously, he couldn't handle the high. I felt deeply ashamed, like I just did something awful. Now, one could argue that Jake was a full grown adult, and was perfectly capable of making his own decisions. But still, I felt bad. He never talked to me ever again after that incident. Until, one day, fast forward to 2013, I spotted him on the street, and we started chatting, talking about the old days. I then mentioned, \"Hey, remember that time I convinced you to smoke weed?\" He had a really strange look on his face when I mentioned that, as if I brought up a traumatic event. I still feel bad to this very day.\n\nIt's safe to say that Jake and I are no longer friends.",

The problem with xtc is that you can only do it once a month or so. Im looking for something similar to that.

I dont want to take a big dose, because I will be in public and will have to socialize.\n\nProblem is that I dont know the dosage of the tab. Friend took 2 of them and had a pretty strong trip.\n\n1) Do you think it is not a terrible idea? Have any of you tried to tak small dosage of acid (but higher than a microdose) and than go on living a normal day?\n\n2) How much do you think I should take? I was thinking a quarter of the tab, but I am not sure. I feel like a half is too much as I have been completely fucked from half a tab in the bast.\n\n I have honestly no idea how I would handle if I took a bigger dose accidentaly. I think I would do alright, but you never know I am not that experienced tripper (I think I tripped 6 or 7 times in my life), but I have been in the public on a smaller dose once and it was alright.\n\nany advice?\n\nThank you for all the answers, love you all guys!\n\nHave a nice day!",

I was explaining her what was, a reuptake inhibitor, and she told me that some antidepressants (ssri i think) made her allucinate in the past because of her bipolar disorder (not a serious case), so maybe she should not take 6-apb.\n\nBtw, I was given 250 mg succinate, and I was told that these are two mild-normal doses.\n\nAnyone thoughts if it is a safe/bad idea for her to take it? Anyone with bipolar disorder has taken it? Advise about the dose?\n\nThanks!",

        "Hello, at first sorry for my English, so let's start. I had very stressful childhood, when I was little boy, my father(ex policeman) was coming home always angry &amp;  got rid all her anger, emotional garbage to family members, exceptionally on me, he didn't beat me, but it was psychological violence, I was in panic &amp; afraid when he was coming home... After that I have lost of mental problems: awful anxiety, fear of tense situation, self confidence under 0 unable(just brain froze) when I was under pressure from someone, I wanted to answer but brain says no, depressed thoughts, was unable to had conversation with girl I like, hadn't erection(first time) when me and my 2 friends went to prostitutes for fun, after than, 5 or 6 years later I had first sex when I was drunk as fuck, were thinking what other would think if I'll do something, also poor sleep and sweating palms, all of this and and more(I can't  remember everything) before I took Gabapentin/Baclofen combo at my 24 and after 2 hours I became a person, which I was dreaming and praying to be all my life, on the second day I met one of the most beautiful stranger girl in that city(I was on holidays) and was taking to her and her 2 friends about 30 minutes without any problems, was self confident and happy, I was shocked, I didn't imagine that it could happened to me, ALL of problems above was gone... after that, 6 years I'm on gaba agonst drugs gabapentin, phhenibut, baclofen &amp; sometimes benzos. taking phenibut 4 years everyday, adding gabapentin &amp; baclofen(but trying to take baclofen rare, I love it, but I know it's too much to take all of them at same day). Now of course I have tolerance and then didn't work like old days, but anyway they make me talkative and sociable, but I'm tired very, very much, I know I should done with those drugs, but I would be same person again, when I hated myself and also know that my withdrawal(HELLISH, like people call just only phenibut's withdrawal) will last tooo long, so what do you think, what should I do? Sorry againd my English, plus I'm high as fuck right now: phenibut+ caffeine two times, gabapentin, baclofen, diazepam &amp; subooxone(injected) I took during day :( Thank you!",

Ever since I first ever smoked weed around 2 years ago I think that I've had visual tracers when I'm sober; seeing slight afterimages of things as they move. It's especially pronounced in the dark. I think I might also have visual snow? Honestly not sure. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid about my health. Does anyone think smoking weed daily alone can cause HPPD, if so, can it worsen it? Anyone have experience with hppd like-symptoms and weed use?",

        "So for about half a year I've been taking tramadol for chronic pain, on my good days I take 100mg and the bad ones 200mg. I trip a couple times a month and usually atop taking tramadol a day or two before i trip to get a cleaner less Dulled trip. \n\nSo I know mdma and tramadol are not a good combination but I am wondering if I take 200mg extended release tramadol Friday afternoon then on Sunday evening I take the mushrooms and mdma if there would be much risk. \n\nAlso how long after the hippy flip would it be safe to take tramadol again. I'm not sure how bad the withdrawals would get also. \n\nThanks for your time and help :)",

        "Hi so I (17f) occasionally drink energy drinks like thrice in a month or maybe more. Nothing bad has ever happened before because I\u2019m very used to monsters original full size cane. I usually get that instead of red bull. I\u2019m a huge monster fan I love their wide range of flavours.\n\nWhenever I have it nothing more than increased heart rate has happened to me before. Yesterday I got the same large 350 ml monster original cane. I didn\u2019t finish it all at once I drank it in 3 parts after half an hour gaps. I smoked a few cigs in between too and that\u2019s nothing out of the blue. Slowly I started feeling very energetic but I soon started having chest pains and my gut was hurting like hell when I twisted and turned. I didn\u2019t give it much thought but when I was about to sleep my back and joints started hurting too and I started getting chills. The night was passing and I woke up 4 times in the middle only to know that I was having very bad chills and my eyes felt like they were burning. My body ache got worse to the point where I had to cry. And my head and jaw started hurting too.\n\nNow this morning my body still hurts very bad and nothing would help to heal it. I\u2019m bedridden fml....idk what\u2019s going on lol...this has never happened before. Any help would be appreciated.",

My Wellbutrin is shoved in there somewhere. \n\nI feel like my head is floating. I am not forgetting the things that have been making me anxious, I simply feel like I can handle them. They no longer faze me. They are nothing. Not to be ignored, but to be conquered. Because I am able, and my world doesn\u2019t have to become so limited as to only have space for one stressor. There can be stressors in my life, there is no need for the stressor to be my life. \n\nI am calm and physically sedated. Yet mentally I maintain some alertness. I feel physically tired, like I\u2019d want to lay in a bed or sit in a comfortable chair, but I could still engage in a show or a card game. A light conversation. Even one that has to be had that I\u2019ve been avoiding.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll go have that conversation. Take a walk. Hug my childhood unicorn plushie. \n\nI\u2019m on a lot of medications that probably don\u2019t go with these, but I dunno...\n\nJust floating. It\u2019s kinda nice.",

        "My parents are both heavy drinkers, mom more so than dad, but they both label themselves as casual drinkers who aren\u2019t addicted, despite drinking at least 10 drinks every afternoon, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people who drink far more but anyway.\n\nI on the other hand, have ADHD and anxiety, and take ritalin and clonazepam (not regularly) for these, and they help me hugely in dealing with this. Mom started asking about these medications and wouldn\u2019t stop asking till I said everything I had in my bag in the bathroom, so she obviously went through that, but denied it. She come and had a big talk to me saying that I shouldn\u2019t be on these medications because they are addictive and she doesn\u2019t want to see me become addicted to a drug and have to take it all the time. \n\nIn my entire life I don\u2019t remember a day that I didn\u2019t see her drinking at some point. She denies being an alcoholic or being addicted to alcohol at all. \n\nIt frustrates me beyond belief how hypocritical she\u2019s acting. I get that she\u2019s concerned for my wellbeing but I\u2019m not abusing those meds and I\u2019m aware of the risks and so is my doctor. Sorry for the random post y\u2019all I just wanted to vent.",

        "This is my opinion on the several methods of consumption, and also the several mixtures of chemicals you can use to make it more potent. Keep in mind, I\u2019m quite experienced with most relevant opiates, oxy, hydro, codeine, tramadol, tapentadol. These chemicals mostly work the same so yeah. \n\nFirst off are the consumption methods. \n\nOral with empty stomache: best preferred way. A normal lasting 2 hour high, just easiest to do and most rewarding. \n\nOral with full stomache: frustrating. It\u2019s like you pop 5 oxies and it\u2019ll feel like 2 and a half, but last twice as long. If you\u2019re on a mission, this is not the move chief.\n\nDissolve under tongue: Good, if you\u2019re on a full stomach or just in a rush, this will be a nice loophole.\n\nSnorting: very painful. The high is 2x as potent but will last maybe 30 minutes, and it is not fun to snort again. Watery eyes, burning nose, and awful drip. \n\nNow we move on to mixtures:\n\nIbuprofen: imo, makes the opiates work stronger as well as having a better analgesic effect. Many question this, though. But it\u2019s ibuprofen, wouldnt hurt taking a bit. \n\nDPH: Makes a much \u201cdirtier\u201d High imo. But it does help you reach that depressed state where things really hit you. \n\nGrape juice: works. Simple enough.",

        "**CONTEXT**\nI have ADHD and finally decided to get it treated. After trip to the Doctor, I was prescribed, one, 70mg Vyvanse capsule per day. This is a very recent prescription that I have acquired only last month. I am just now starting my first refill bottle, or starting my second month of Vyvanse. I don't usually take it consistently, and skip days quite often. Today, I decided to take 2 capsules and see what would happen. As I am writing this, the high as almost fully worn off, which led to my decision of taking another 70mg capsule. I am currently waiting for it to kick in. With this in mind, here is a summary of how my night has gone:\n\n**STORY**\nI always read about how much people love the high of amphetamines and wondered what it was like. Today, I was bored and after reading some reddit reports, I decided to take the plunge and take 140mg of Vyvanse. If reddit posters could do it, why not, right? I didn't take both at once. Instead, I took the second capsule about an hour after the first, so it took a while for the 2 capsules to work together. And about 3 hours later, they did. When I tell you, I could understand everything and anything that I wanted to, I could. I came up with an idea of how to invent different things. I became a fucking genius. While that was fun, it gets even better. Eventually, the vyvanse kicked in to the point where I had superhuman focus. Instead of taking this focus out on my inventions, I took it out on myself. I became my fucking brain. I genuinely sat typing to my friend on my phone for 6 hours straight without moving or eating. That may sound like an exaggeration, but it isn't. I forgot any and everything existed. I was so entranced and so fixed on what I was trying to say and what I was realizing that I didn't exist anymore. I talked to my friend about myself only in the third person. I referred to myself by name or she/her. And the \"I\" that was telling my friend things was another fucking being beyond my comprehension. I was literally my own thoughts and only my thoughts. Everything else ceased to exist, even basic human concepts. I don't even know how to explain what I experienced. It was only a feeling I could describe as being God. Like I became my own God and I wasn't a person anymore. My person became a universe that my own God created and understood inside and out. I was all knowing. That is all.",

        "and looking out... no, not really. That's the best way I can describe it. \n\nSubstance: Dexedrine\u2122 Extended Release, 15mg\nDosage: 15mg TID\nOther: Bigass fruit smoothie in the morning, big dip in energy levels around 10:00. Compensated, 15mg  + 1.2L of water 07:00-17:00 \n2 TUMs Antacid (CaCl) at 06:50, ~6-10min before 15mg 1/3\n\n\n\n\nI guess I double-dosed or fucked my dose up in some way **other** than the fat pineapple smoothie I had this morning. Dexedrine, 15mg ER; One in the morning, then the smoothie within 2 hours (which I assumed burnt that dose). I took one at like, say, noonish-maybe, and then another after work. Or two after work. Or maybe three, I don't know. \n\nI got home some time ago and all was swell, I was my usual stupid self. Typically at this point, I become my stupid baked self (which is unreasonably frustrating lately I dunno why I do it tbh) but today was different.\n\nI was walking from my bedroom to the bathroom, or vice versa, fuck, I dunno. I was mid-stride when I felt what can best be described as a sheet of glass falling over my.... like, the \"body\" you feel, your \"propioceived self\" if you will; the \"map\" that tells you whether that mosquitos on your forehead or your neck.\n\nI feel like old tires, or something, like a total and massive release of tension accompanied, paradoxically, by the stillness of everything except my breathing. Every movement is *executed* rather than just loaded from RAM like some renegade script that was designed to be the template for an action, and not a... an effective action. Instead, now, it's more like driving a forklift but never having driven a forklift. \n\nEverything is incredibly clear, my heart rate is about 88 (I'm relaxed) but the *tension* in my chest is right on top of my sternum, almost outside my body rather than crossing an \"X\" between my nipples and my asshole like it usually does. My neck feels relaxed and very firm, and my mouth tastes metallic. \n\nMaybe noteworthy, when that \"sheet of glass\" shatters it replaces my hearing. Like, not hearing more or less, but *differently* ; like the sounds exist within the air and actually travel, rather than being generated within my brain like Gordon Freeman's moustache is on the computer, by the computer, whatever. \n\nI don't recognize myself. I feel like my body shape correction has been turned off and everything's blue-shifted (is that a word?). My proportions are all off and fucked up but look **way** better than they do... or than I'm pretty sure I think they do. My head's smaller and my face is more... drawn, and more sculpted. I look like a wax dummy in some serial killer's remote mansion. My skin looks and feels like an animatron. So does my motion, actually, typing this.\n\nEmotions are entirely optional rn. I can pretty much choose whatever I need to be at this specific moment. It's like being at the projector, controlling the images you're seeing in the big-ass mirror you've setup in the theater. Absolutely every element of my existence except for the length of this post, and for the next 5 - 10 min at least, is within my control and entirely scriptable.\n\nWhat is this called? I'd've thought that the words \"breaking through\" was the term until both google and duckie returned limp-dick-squat. Is this normal on dexedrine or am I stroking or something? \n\nNo autocorrect is not on and holy fuck why isn't this ever happening at another time? Protein deficiency? Antacid interaction? Were my B Groups runnin' dry? Is this what healthy feels like or is this what really-super-fucked-up feels like? Why does my mouth hurt and taste like metal?\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**Think I fucked up today's dose of Dexedrine and became an animatron living in my own body... like spock, but rubber and a little fucking weird looking.**",

        "I\u2019m 20 years old and from England. For the past year or so I\u2019ve been a functioning cocaine user to the point where I guess I could no longer call it recreational,  up until recent events I would of definitely argued that I didn\u2019t have a problem and i could stop whenever. I went about my weekend in the usual way, I\u2019d buy an 8th and sniff it over the course of the weekend usually stopping at 1/2am to allow myself to sleep and recover to start the next day, however on this particular weekend I thought fuck it I\u2019m gonna stay up all night, so I carried on sniffing all Friday night,through Saturday into the early hours of Sunday morning. on the Sunday things took a turn for the worst when I broke out in cold sweats and kept thinking I could hear my dad and his girlfriend arguing in the room next to me and every time I went out there it was silent, I thought they were arguing about me for whatever reason and part of me knew it was deep cocaine psychosis but I couldn\u2019t help but succumb to the paranoia and repeatedly check the corridor to see if the voices in my head were real or not. All in all it was not a pleasant experience. I knew I should of stopped there and then but I couldnt, I\u2019d now been up for nearly 3 days and I was still sniffing when the pains started, it began as just a mild discomfort in my arm but it scared me enough to stop for a while. I had a short day nap to try and rest my body abit. When I woke up it was late Sunday evening and the pain had completely gone. I decided to start sniffing again, several hours in the sweating started, then the pain only far worse around my left arm and it felt like something was sat on my chest squeezing my heart. I knew what was going on but I thought maybe if i ignored it it will go away. I couldn\u2019t exactly go into any of my families room and tell them I was having a heart attack due to cocaine so I left my house went to a school near it and called an ambulance, the pain peaked whilst I was on the phone to the point that I was curled up thinking I was dying. When the paramedics arrived they said I had a pretty sever heart arrhythmia with it beating irregular at a stupidly fast rate. I was rushed into hospital and after spending hours being prodded and poked with needles followed by x-rays I was lucky enough to not need a stent in my heart. I was discharged after a day of monitoring and was lucky to still be alive. I just wanted to warn you all that remember to be cautious when using coke if you are going to your are going to use it at all remember to sleep, drink fluids and eat food before and after even if it\u2019s the last thing on your mind. Most importantly once any warning symptoms occur just do yourself a favour and don\u2019t ignore it, it\u2019s not worth it.\nThis was 2 days ago now and I plan on staying clean, no drugs worth it if it does damage like this, stay safe people.\nAny questions ask away",

        "I love the cannabis industry rn. I had to take a long break around 2 years due to certain circumstances. Well I finally can smoke again, but I was hesitant at first, I saw some prices from a dispensary and I was not interested in it. Long story short a friend started selling cartridges that were fire. Especially for the price I decided why not. I stopped by a smoke shop, picked up a battery and bought the cart. I was in a Panda Express drive through when I hit it and i was gone. Baked beyond belief I hurried home and munched out. \n\nA few days later a old acquaintance messaged me and told me he had a pound for 100$. I thought it was trash weed but nope this was straight fire. Said his harvest was way too big (he expected raids, and crops to not grow but everything went well) and that I\u2019ve looked out for him when he was down, that we were basically brothers, and according to him \u201cwhat\u2019s the point in growing weed if you can\u2019t hook up the homies for the low\u201d. Needless to say I was baked every day for a while. I really love the weed industry right now.",

        "Today has been one wild day. So today I started college and I didn\u2019t have class for about 3 hours so I decided to go buy some weed nothing special. So it was about a 30min drive from my school and I left to go pick up my friend to come w me. We drive up to our dealers restaurant/bar which he has been selling out of all summer he was the best in the area so everyone knew about him.  \n\nMy friend and I pull up to the shop I tell him to wait in the car as I go in. I go in hand him the money and as I do cops in ski masks bust in yelling \u201cPOLICE SEACH WARRANT GET ON THE GROUND\u201d obo I get on the ground completely panicked. \n\nA cop then comes at me while I\u2019m on the ground with his gun out and detains me and puts me on a chair while they start searching. I sit there as I watch them pull out pounds of weed, lots of coke, about $1000 worth of shroom chocolates and some pills. \n\nThe main guy (owner of everything) got arrested. His son who is my age (18) was told he\u2019s getting charged with association with the dealing the worker was also charged with the association shit. \n\nThey let me and my friend go. But this has been by far the scariest shit that\u2019s ever happened to me.\n\nTL:DR buying weed cops come in w a search warrant put me in handcuffs I get away Scott free my my dealer not so much :( rip his poor soul he didn\u2019t deserve it one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nAlso sorry for format mobile",

        "I\u2019ve only done them a few times but when I do, the feeling never ceases to amaze me. You feel it kick in slightly, then eventually you just get an overwhelming blanket of comfort and euphoria. Not only that but your head/brain feels like someone is massaging it with the worlds warmest and softest hands, constantly. It\u2019s the best slight-pressure feeling ever. Your chest also slightly sinks/tingles every so often. The nods are great too, and just feeling like you\u2019re in a perfect dream. Amazing\n\nDefinitely my favorite class of drugs but not the most addicting (personally)...I think simply understanding the addiction potential is what has helped me control myself with these. Stay safe everyone",

        "So one of my really good mates asked me Tuesday if I wanted to go on a trip with him. I said, \u201cHell yeah. Pack your gear and I\u2019ll load up the camper and let\u2019s go!\u201d He said, \u201cWell I meant more like psychedelic trip?\u201d This was completely unexpected and out of the blue as he doesn\u2019t really do these sorts of things but he\u2019s dead set on wanting to experience it. So long story short is we\u2019re going camping tomorrow at my place (I own thirty acres of timber out in the boonies) I\u2019m gonna stay sober and let him do his thing but make sure he enjoys himself. I\u2019m really excited for this. Really looking forward to that moment where his whole world opens up. I\u2019ve taken shrooms countless times and I\u2019ve never had a bad trip. I only do them when I\u2019m out in nature though and I think that helps. I think I have pretty much everything we could possibly need to make sure he has a pleasant journey but I just figured I\u2019d ask you fine folks if there was anything that you wish could\u2019ve been/or like to have around during your trips.

        "Hello, im turning to this subreddit, looking for help. \n\nAs someone who started abusing drugs at a very young age, i have completely ruined my brain, i can't feel happiness, i dont see the point in doing anything when im sober, even the smallest form of human interaction makes me have extreme anxiety, and a whole lot of other things thta indicate my brain has been ruined and not had the chance to fully mature. Now that im older, have a job and a relationship, i really need to start fixing myself. I've had some success with removing bad habits, like constantly showing only anger and generally being a douchebag, but the rest is giving me so much difficulties.\n\nSo my question is, how did you people stop your addiction, how long did it take for you personally, and if anyone knows something about human psychology, is it possible for me to get out of this hole i dug? \n\nKind regards,\nXav",

        "Hello ! I've smoked weed and hash almost daily for at least 6 months and i've seen my consumption skyrocket in this timespan, i only use at nighttime to chill and watch videos. The problem is that it makes it very difficult for me to wake up in the morning and it also slows me and my intellectual capacities at least for half the day until 3 pm. I'll start going to college in september and i'm very concerned about this bad habit, as it prevents me from being productive. I'm an anxious person and the high makes me relax but i wish i didn't feel shitty the next day. I think i can now call it an addiction because i keep smoking even if I know that the effects will make me unable to do useful things, it mostly takes away my motivation. If one of you feels the same because of weed or if you have some advice, i'd be glad to hear it. Thank you",

        "It's taken me a few years to recognize it, but I am an addict.\n\nIt started during the last couple years of high school. My parents had just caught me smoking weed and grounded me. When it was over I started hanging out with a friend who's mom had an oxycontin prescription and would give us free percocet whenever I came over. I liked it because my parents couldn't tell if I was high or not, my eyes didn't turn red and I didn't smell like weed. I could be high all the time and nobody would know!\n\nFast-forward to senior year of high school, I am now taking 80-100 mg of percocet a day. I had a group of 4 people, my childhood friend I had known for over 10 years, my friend who's mom had the percs, and this other girl we knew. We would all go to the woman's house after school and do drugs until nighttime. My nose is constantly bleeding because my entertainment consists of deciding if I want to snort or parachute. I have probably 15 connections, none of whom I know personally, and I am spending over a grand a month. Every morning I start the day by puking my guts out and then running out back and smoking weed to make myself feel better, then railling another percocet. I had started dabbling in meth and had done heroin once or twice too. At this time I think I developed my eating disorder because I would starve myself to get higher. I starved myself every single day and even now I feel nauseous and have to force-feed whenever I eat.\n\nI was heavily addicted for a good six months, which are a total blur to me now. I saw some things and did some things I don't like to talk about, but eventually my money ran out. I didn't want my parents to know I was addicted, so I pretended I had the flu and locked myself in my room for 3 days. Told my dealers to never contact me again and deleted their numbers off my phone (boy did I regret that by the end of day 1. I remember screaming at my friend to give me our connect's number and he was like \"sorry bro, can't\" I was so pissed). The withdrawals had me crying from pain. But I didn't consider myself an addict because nobody who's REALLY an addict gets over it that easily, right? They have to go to rehab and stuff, right?\n\nAt first, I felt awesome. I had finally given up something that controlled so much of my life and who I was hanging out with. Then, every day I started thinking about it and how much I wanted it. I started drinking heavily to distract myself. This continued as I went through college, I was drinking myself to sleep every night (when I wasn't on acid), and I started snorting heroin with this dude on my floor. To this day I think my alcohol and drug abuse in college was the sole reason I flunked out.\n\nAfter college I was a total wreck. I was hella depressed and slowly started getting back into oxy and I was going to raves weekly and snorting meth and cocaine. I was living with my parents and I don't know how they didn't realize I was fucked up pretty much 100% of the time. Looking back on it, they probably did but my relationship with them was so bad at that point I'm sure they just didn't want to say anything until they had to. I ended up meeting a friend at the time, let's call him Matt. Matt helped me out of my slump, we'd go hiking and kayaking on the regular; only hiccup was that he was really into xanax and suddenly I was into xanax too. At one point he got me some 5mg roxies and I took 3 of them and felt awful. I swore I would never take oxycontin again.\n\nThen my childhood friend died that summer in rehab. Totally ruined me. I started crushing a handle every night; my parents knew I was drinking too much and threatened to kick me out. Me and Matt ended up moving to Colorado because I couldn't drive around my hometown anymore without constantly thinking of my friend. I still blame myself for his death because I encouraged him to do drugs in the first place.\n\nI still think I'm an addict. While I'm in a much better mood, I still drink every night and god I can't go a morning without weed. I still think about oxy and how much I want it but I can't find anyone up here who sells and I'm kinda glad about that. I haven't done oxycontin in over a year, but I'm still an addict. I still can't have fun sober. Shit ruined my personality and my health. I don't think I'll ever get to the point when I'm \"back to normal.\" I am an addict and I always will be.",

And 2.) why did i previously think amphetamines  made users constipated? Thanks in advance!",

However towards the end of the school year I regretted that a lot. Seeing them enjoy senior year together knowing that could have been me made me so dam depressed. I am so depressed with how my senior year ended up that it has made me even suicidal knowing that I can never fix my decision. No matter what I do I can\u2019t seem to forgive myself. I am almost out of options here and I am wondering if psychedelics could help open up and change my mind about my life and maybe allow me to forgive myself.",

        "What up fellers, I have an interesting one this time.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve been using my arizer air 2, as well as a dab pen I have with a cart I got from a close friend (supposedly good quality, in reality I have no idea so it\u2019s a roll of the dice). I found that if I vape 2-3 bowls I of the newish shit I have in my arizer air 2(which I should mention I bought a few gs of from another close friend the same night), then taking some nice pulls from my dab cart at the end of that, I slip into a psychedelic-like high which is really something only comparable to a nicely dosed edible. \n\nIt\u2019s usually so intense I have to drink water along side it, and a lot of the time I will have to just get on the bed and curl up for like 5 mins til I\u2019m at least 1% functional again lmao. But anyways after hitting the dab pen in this process I get some really weird body sensation, (overall body temp rises) and I feel I almost completely lose control of my thoughts, similar to how I hear shrooms is. I should mention I only have done acid once with a group of people who I was already growing quite close to at the time, so I don\u2019t truly know if this is just like shrooms or nah, I\u2019m just a daily weed vaper tbh (LOL). However I will say that it has now made way more scared to even try shrooms with the friends I was planning to, cuz the weed trip is almost too much to handle. Makes me think there\u2019s NO WAY the shrooms thought fuckery wouldn\u2019t be super uncomfortably deep.\n\nAnyways, the high typically creeps up on me after that initial killer 5 mins too, like sometimes I think even over half an hour later it\u2019ll hit super hard and I\u2019ll have to drink water to calm down. The weirdest part is that once this super high state starts I have really really deep profound thoughts about EVERYTHING I think about, and it even comes in fucking WAVES. The waves feel super intense, its almost like I\u2019m getting sensory overload, and it feels almost like when I\u2019m at the top of a roller coaster. It legit seems exactly like shrooms(sounds) so now I\u2019m curious...      \n\nI\u2019m super super super high, but I kinda wonder if maybe the cart had some researcher chem in it and it\u2019s either the same or kinda similar to the one people sell pretending it\u2019s shrooms? That would explain the similar effects. I know my friend went to a legal state over summer and copped hella shit, but he never clarified whether this cart he sold me was from there like his other stuff was, or if it was from some plug friend of his. This shit just makes me sus. Otherwise, what I\u2019m experiencing is seriously a weed breakthrough, which I\u2019ve never heard of. Then again, I am completely binging unlike most people would do, which is why nobody talks about this.\n\nHitting the dab cart after hitting the vaporizer for 30 mins(the part of the ritual before the dap pen rips) would literally affect like at least 99% of people who smoke so maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so surprised. It\u2019s definitely not something I should do everyday, (unless I find myself making a ton of money consistently) but it is the most intense, deep high that I\u2019ve ever had that wasn\u2019t from any edible. It definitely affected me more than plenty of the weaker edibles I\u2019ve had, although I can\u2019t compare it to the good ones because it\u2019s been so long sadly. \n\nAnyways, has anyone else has a psychedelic-like experience from a high/strong weed dose? I know I can\u2019t be the only who\u2019s tried some shit like this lol.\n\n**tldr;** Used weed vaporizer for 30 mins straight, took some nice rips from dab pen right after that.(cart from close friend, weed used in vaporizer was from a different close friend the same night) Had psychedelic-like experience that was very very close to what I hear shrooms is like, was I just at a [11]+, or is there a chance the cart had RCs(research chemicals)? Am I onto something or am I just tweaking y\u2019all? Lemme know please. Especially if you\u2019ve experienced anything I did in the post. :)",

        "Hello Cummunity,\nI havend used psychodelics for like 1 month. \nAnd last night i went to bed and closed my eyes and i got flashing lights with closed eyes.\nDoes anyone have this experince too.\nI have found this on wikipedia\n\nPhosphenes can be directly induced by mechanical, electrical, or magnetic stimulation of the retina or visual cortex as well as by random firing of cells in the visual system. Phosphenes have also been reported by meditators[4] (commonly called nimitta), people who go for long periods without visual stimulation (also known as the prisoner's cinema), or those who are using psychedelic drugs.[Wikipedia]",

I also have pharma script Concerta and Klonopin. My friends were wondering if out would be worth it to turn it or even the pure psilocibin I get onto an injectable or capable form. I'm about 99% sure DMT is the only thing in vape form, but inform me of on wrong. Thank you very much! I currently have access to 30mg ABG 30 Morphine and 10mg hydrocodone",

I have a lot of experience with everything except ritalin and nangs. Ket and acid is generally my go to combo but I was thinking of trying ritalin for the first time and seeing how that goes and taking other stuff the next day maybe. I'll also be drinking, but I don't drink very much normally and even less if I take drugs.\nThanks in advance :)\n\n\nEDIT: If I was to take nangs, what should I combine with them?",
